Title: Rational Polarization
Abstract: When information is of lower dimension than the model generating the data, Bayesian learning need not converge to the truth. Because the information is of lower dimension than the model, agents face an identification problem, affecting the role of data in inference. We provide conditions under which Bayesian learning is asymptotically inconsistent with positive probability, and sometimes almost surely. Robustly, two agents with differing priors who observe identical, unambiguous data may disagree forever, with stronger disagreement the more data is observed. Agents rationally use common observations to differentially update beliefs about different parameters.

Title: Regional Concentration of Industry in China: decentralised choices or a central plan?
Abstract: The economic growth and development of China during the past 35 years has been associated with
profound impacts on the well-being of the Chinese people, on patterns of global trade and prices of manufactured goods, and on industrial location within China itself. Many would view Chinaâ€™s government and
its policies as the dominant, perhaps exclusive, force in determining location and concentration of Chinese
industry. This raises the question: can a theoretical approach based on decentralised optimization and
location choice provide insights concerning the ongoing changes in industrial concentration in China? We
address this question, putting forward a simple model and testing it using Chinese data.

Title: Heat Stress: The Impact of Ambient Temperature on Occupational Injuries in the US
Abstract: Work-related injuries in the US generate annual costs exceeding 250 billion, with approximately one
third of these costs coming from the direct health care expenses of dealing with the injuries and the remainder
coming from the impacts on economic productivity associated with accidental injury. Beyond these costs,
considerable expenses and efforts are devoted to avoiding injuries, and monitoring workplaces for compliance
with safety rules.
There are many factors that can increase the probability of workplace accidents, as well as a variety of
regulations and regulatory agencies designed to reduce or limit these factors and to monitor compliance with
regulations by employers. Of course there are some factors that even the most well-intentioned employers
can not control, or that may not be easy to regulate at the local or even the national level. In this paper
we investigate one of these factors: the ambient temperature within which work takes place. Clinical and
empirical evidence such as that presented in Colquhoun (1969), Chiles (1958) or Azer, McNall and Leung
(1972) indicates that high temperatures and heat stress diminish mental alertness, vigilance and ability to
perform complex tasks.
In a recent paper, Deschenes and Greenstone (2011) documented the potential impact of climate change
on mortality in the US. Their research indicates that between 2010 and 2099, increased temperature could
be expected to increase annual mortality rates in the US by about 3%, with about half of the heat-related
deaths occurring in the South Atlantic and West South Central regions of the US.
We investigate the impact of increased temperature on occupational injuries in heat-sensitive industries
in the US, providing what appear to be the first available estimates of the impact of increased ambient
temperatures on workplace injuries. Using some approximations from climate models we provide estimates
of the potential economic cost of climate change caused by this previously undiscussed mechanism.

Title: The Impact of Early Childhood Rainfall Shocks on the Evolution of Cognitive and Non-cognitive Skills
Abstract: This paper is the first to estimate the extent to which early childhood climatic
shocks affect both cognitive and non-cognitive skills as measured at multiple points
in childhood and adolescence. We assess the impact of rainfall observed in utero
and during the first two years of life by analyzing a rich longitudinal study of rural
youth in a poor province in China. Our empirical strategy entails estimating the
impact of rainfall on various measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills utilizing
a reduced form strategy, conditional on county and year-of-birth fixed effects. The
results indicate that there is a significant impact of early shocks, particularly shocks
in utero and in the first year of life, on cognitive skills, but that this impact may be
declining over time. There is little evidence of any impact on non-cognitive skills.
We also present evidence that the declining salience of early shocks is consistent
with compensatory strategies employed by parents.

Title: Grain Into Gold? The Impact of Agricultural Income Shocks on Rural Chinese Households
Abstract: This paper analyzes whether there is evidence of a poverty trap driven by credit
constraints and non-linearities in the return to capital in rural China in the 1990s,
estimating the effect of positive income shocks experienced by rural households as
a result of increases in the price paid for mandatory grain quota sales. Households
were required to sell part of their grain output to the state at a below-market
price, and increases in the quota price generated income shocks that also varied
cross-sectionally in accordance with crop composition. The identification strategy
exploits climatically driven variation in crop composition in conjunction with quota
price fluctuations to identify quasi-random variation in the size of the positive
income shock and estimate its impact on economic outcomes. The results suggest
agricultural investment decreases and investment in non-agricultural businesses and
migration increase as households gain increased income, consistent with a poverty
trap in which households are initially constrained from entering new productive
sectors. There is also evidence of large increases in consumption and borrowing.

Title: Capital Structure and Corporate Performance in Late Imperial Russia
Abstract: We investigate the financing of corporations in industrializationâ€™s early stages. A new balance
sheet database featuring all Imperial Russian corporations in 1914 suggests that Russian
corporations exhibited considerable financial flexibility. We emphasize financing differences
between two types of Russian corporations: share partnerships and A-corporations. Share
partnerships issued greater dividends as a proportion of share capital or profits, were less likely
to issue bonds, and had larger accounts payable. Financial strategies varied with age, size, and
sector in a manner consistent with modern corporate finance theories. This optimistic assessment
suggests that absence of low-cost incorporation impeded Russian industrial and economic
development.

Title: Anchoring Bias in Recall Data
Abstract: Understanding the magnitude and source of measurement biases in self-reported data is critical to
effective economic policy research. This paper examines the role of anchoring bias in self-reports of
objective and subjective outcomes under recall. The research exploits a unique panel survey data set
collected over a three-year period from four countries in Central America. It assesses whether respondents
use their reported value of specific measures from the most recent survey period as a cognitive heuristic
when recalling the value from a previous period, while controlling for the value they reported earlier. We
find strong evidence of sizable anchoring bias in self-reported retrospective indicators for both objective
measures (household and per capita income, wages, and hours spent on the householdâ€™s main activity)
and subjective measures (reports of happiness, health, stress, and well-being). In general, we also observe
a larger bias in response to negative changes for objective indicators and a larger bias in response to
positive changes for subjective indicators.

Title: Employment Risk and Job-Seeker Performance
Abstract: High levels of job uncertainty in developing countries may have significant implications for job
performance. This paper examines the relationship between employment risk and job-seeker performance.
To induce exogenous variation in employment risk, the outside options for job seekers undergoing a real
recruitment process were randomized by assigning them a 0, 1, 5, 50, 75, or 100 percent chance of real
alternative employment of the same duration and wage as the jobs for which they were applying. The
findings show that job-seeker performance is highest and effort is lowest among those assigned the lowest
employment risk (a guaranteed alternative job), and performance is lowest and effort highest among those
facing the highest employment risk (those without any job guarantee). Moreover, a nonlinear relationship
exists between employment risk and performance.
The findings are consistent with a framework that ties together insights from economics and
psychologyâ€”that is, performance is an increasing function of effort and an inverse U-shaped function of
stress. The results are not driven by gift exchange, stereotype threat, or the nutritional efficiency wage
hypothesis.
These performance improvements have significant welfare implications. In this study, job seekers
assigned a high probability of receiving an outside option were twice as likely to be hired in the standard
job recruitment process compared with those assigned a low probability of receiving an outside option.
More broadly, these results suggest that stress-induced performance reductions are a potential mechanism
through which exposure to high employment risk can perpetuate poverty and unemployment.

Title: Employment Exposure: Employment and Wage Effects in Urban Malawi
Abstract: Labor earnings are critical to exiting poverty. Understanding the returns to the determinants of
wage growth is thus important. This paper examines the role of one driver of wage growth,
acquired work experience. We exploit an experiment that randomized probabilistic job offers to
estimate the employment and wage effects of short term jobs among young men in an urban low
income setting. The results suggest large returns even among relatively well-educated yet still
under-employed individuals. Individuals are more likely to access subsequent employment in the
position for which they obtained work experience, suggesting a perceived return to the experience
by other firms. Returns are largest among those scoring poorly on a literacy and numeracy test and
those with existing sector specific evidence.

Title: Collective Action and Representation in Autocracies: Evidence from Russia's Great Reforms
Abstract: We explore the relationship between capacity for collective action and representation
in autocracies with data from Imperial Russia. Our primary empirical exercise relates
peasant representation in new institutions of local self-government to the frequency
of peasant unrest in the decade prior to reform. To correct for measurement error in
the unrest data and other sources of endogeneity, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in
two determinants of peasant unrest: the historical incidence of serfdom and religious
polarization. We find that peasants were granted less representation in districts with
more frequent unrest in preceding yearsâ€”a relationship consistent with the AcemogluRobinson
model of political transitions and inconsistent with numerous other theories
of institutional change. At the same time, we observe patterns of redistribution in
subsequent years that are inconsistent with the commitment mechanism central to the
Acemoglu-Robinson model. Building on these results, we discuss possible directions for
future theoretical work.

Title: Long-Run Consequences of Labor Coercion: Evidence from Russian Serfdom
Abstract: This paper examines the long-run consequences of Russian serfdom. We use novel
data measuring the intensity of labor coercion at the district level in 1861. Our results
show that a greater legacy of serfdom is associated with lower economic well-being today.
We apply an IV strategy that exploits the transfer of serfs from monastic lands in 1764
to establish causality. Exploring mechanisms, we find a positive correlation between the
earlier experience of serfdom and pre-Soviet urbanization and land inequality, with negative
implications for human capital investment and agglomeration over the long-run.

Title: A Collateral Theory of the Cash-Synthetic basis
Abstract: We study how the cash-synthetic basis changes in response to variation in the extent
to which a risky asset and its derivative debt contracts can be used as collateral. We
use a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, collateralized financial
contracts, and multiple states of uncertainty, and exogenously vary which assets in the
economy can be used as collateral. We show that the existence of a non-zero basis is
fundamentally due to differences in the collateral values of the safe and risky assets, as
well as the collateral value of debt backed by the risky asset. When the risky asset has
greater collateral value than the risk-free asset, a positive basis emerges (vice versa).
Additionally, because the risky asset and its derivative debt contracts will always have
different collateral values, the cash-synthetic basis for the risky asset will always differ
from the basis for the risky debt.

Title: Maternal Education, Parental Investment and Non-Cognitive Characteristics in Rural China
Abstract: This paper evaluates the parental response to non-cognitive variation across siblings in Gansu
province, China, employing a household xed eects specication. The non-cognitive indices
are dened as the inverse of externalizing challenges (behavioral problems) and internalizing
challenges (anxiety and withdrawal). The results suggest that there is signicant heterogeneity
with respect to maternal education; educated mothers compensate for dierences between their
children, investing more in a child exhibiting greater non-cognitive decits, while less educated
mothers reinforce these dierences. Most importantly, there is evidence that these investments
lead to the narrowing of non-cognitive decits over time for children of more educated mothers.

Title: Regulation-Induced Pollution Substitution
Abstract: Regulations may cause firms to re-optimize over pollution inputs, leading to unintended consequences. By regulating air emissions in particular counties, the Clean Air Act (CAA) gives firms incentives to substitute: 1) toward polluting other media, like landfills and waterways; and 2) toward pollution from plants in other counties. Using EPA Toxic Release Inventory data, I examine the effect of CAA regulation on these types of substitution. Regulated plants increase water emissions by 105 percent (72 log points). Regulation of an average plant increases air emissions at unregulated plants within the same firm by 13 percent. This leakage offsets 57 percent of emissions reductions by regulated firms.

Title: Do Airbnb Properties Affect House Prices?
Abstract: The growth of peer-to-peer markets has provided a mechanism through which private individuals can
enter a market as small scale, often temporary, suppliers of a good or service. Companies that facilitate
this type of supply have attracted controversy in cities around the world, with concerns regarding Uber
and Airbnb in particular. Both companies have been subject to criticism for failing to pay taxes to local
authorities and for avoiding regulatory oversight that constrains more traditional suppliers of these services.
It is not surprising that these companies have been criticized by more traditional suppliers of short term
accommodation or transportation as presenting unfair competition, and attempts have been made to ban
provision of these services in several cities around the world.
A central complaint concerning Airbnb focuses on the impact of short-term rental properties on the
value of residential property. A report prepared by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New
York lists these impacts among a number of concerns: do Airbnb rentals provide a black market in unsafe
hotels? Do short-term rentals make New York City less affordable? Is the influx of out-of-town visitors
upsetting the quiet of longstanding residential neighborhoods?
These concerns pose difficulties because they imply different impacts on the values of residential properties.
If short-term rentals provided via Airbnb create a concentration of what are effectively unsafe hotels,
upsetting quiet residential neighborhoods, they would generate a local concentration of externalities that
might be expected to depress property values rather than make housing less affordable. Alternatively, if
these externality effects are modest relative to the impacts of space diverted from providing housing for
residents to providing short-term accommodation for visitors, then local concentration of Airbnb properties
may increase house prices.
Perhaps because of this confusion, it is possible to find divergent viewpoints expressed about the impacts
of Airbnb in the popular press and in consultant reports, but (to our knowledge) no careful study that
estimates the direct impact of Airbnb rental availability on house prices. This paper presents such a study
in the context of New York City.

Title: The Macrogenoeconomics of Comparative Development
Abstract: A vibrant literature has emerged in recent years to explore the influences of human evolution and the genetic composition of populations on the comparative economic performance of societies, highlighting the roles played by the Neolithic Revolution and the prehistoric "out of Africa" migration of anatomically modern humans in generating worldwide variations in the composition of genetic traits across populations. The recent attempt by Nicholas Wade's "A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History" to expose the evolutionary origins of comparative economic development to a wider audience provides an opportunity to review this important literature in the context of his theory.

Title: Gray Matters: Fetal Pollution Exposure and Human Capital Formation
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of fetal exposure to air pollution on 4th grade test scores in Santiago, Chile. We rely on comparisons across siblings which address concerns about locational sorting and all other time-invariant family characteristics that can lead to endogenous exposure to poor environmental quality. We also exploit data on air quality alerts to help address concerns related to short-run time-varying avoidance behavior, which has been shown to be important in a number of other contexts. We find a strong negative effect from fetal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) on math and language skills measured in 4th grade. These effects are economically significant and our back of the envelope calculations suggest that the 50% reduction in CO in Santiago between 1990 and 2005 increased lifetime earnings by approximately 100 million USD per birth cohort.

Title: Time Use and Productivity: The Wage Returns to Sleep
Abstract: We investigate the productivity effects of the single largest use of time - sleep. Using time use diaries from the United States, we demonstrate that later sunset time reduces worker sleep and wages. Sunset time one hour later decreases short-run wages by 0.5% and long-run wages by 4.5%. After investigating this relationship and ruling out alternative hypotheses, we implement an instrumental variables specification that provides the first causal estimates of the impact of sleep on wages. A one-hour increase in average weekly sleep increases wages by 1.5% in the short run and by 4.9% in the long run.

Title: The Effects of Road Pricing on Driver Behavior and Air Pollution
Abstract: Exploiting the natural experiment created by an unanticipated court injunction, we evaluate driver responses to road pricing. We find evidence of intertemporal substitution toward unpriced times and spatial substitution toward unpriced roads. The effect on traffic volume varies with public transit availability. Net of these responses, Milan's pricing policy reduces air pollution substantially, generating large welfare gains. In addition, we use long-run policy changes to estimate price elasticities.

Title: When Do Punishment Institutions Work?
Abstract: While peer punishment sometimes motivates increased cooperation, it sometimes reduces cooperation. We use a lab experiment to study why punishment sometimes fails. We begin with a gift exchange game with punishment as it has typically been implemented therein since punishment has often backfired in this game. We modify two features of punishment that could increase its efficacy: punishment's strength and its timing (whether the punisher publicly pre-commits to punishment or acts after the punishee). We replicate the result that peer punishment in gift exchange games can reduce cooperation, but show that this bad outcome disappears if punishment is more powerful. This does not seem primarily due to punishment's threat leading to spiteful behavior: we find little evidence of spite, and the same punishment does not perform better when it is chosen after the fact. We find two main reasons that punishment decreases cooperation: lower wages are offered (a stick is substituted for a carrot); and many punishers don't design punishment to properly incentivize high effort, particularly when punishment is weak in power. Punishment that is not publicly pre-committed is not effective in this game, even though this kind of punishment is similar to that used in public good games in the literature where punishment does seem to increase cooperation. The only punishment institution that increases cooperation is high-power punishment that is publicly pre-committed, which works through strong incentives rather than reciprocity. Finally, the existence of a punishment institution often decreases social surplus (when punishment-related losses are considered), although it may eventually increase social surplus if it is powerful and publicly pre-committed.

Title: Securitized Markets, International Capital Flows, and Global Welfare
Abstract: We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on international capital flows, growth, and welfare in a two country general equilibrium model. We find that capital flows from the high- to low-margin country, leading to high investment levels and economic growth in the latter. Despite low growth, the high-margin country substantially gains in terms of welfare through better risk sharing opportunities. The ability to tranche asset-backed securities in one country leads to offsetting portfolio flows, creating gross financial flows. Exogenous fluctuations in collateral requirements and the introduction of tranching have important implications for both net and gross international flows.

Title: Debt Collateralization and Maximal Leverage
Abstract: We study how allowing agents to use debt as collateral affects asset prices, leverage, and interest rates in a general equilibrium, heterogeneous-agent model with collateralized financial contracts and multiple states of uncertainty. In the absence of debt collateralization, multiple contracts are traded in equilibrium, with some agents borrowing using risky debt and others borrowing with risk-free debt. When agents can use debt contracts as collateral to borrow from other agents, margin requirements decrease, asset prices increase, and the interest rate on risky debt decreases. We characterize equilibrium for N states and L levels of debt collateralization and prove that enough levels of debt collateralization creates an equilibrium featuring maximal leverage on all debt contracts. In the dynamic model, debt collateralization creates larger asset price volatility.

Title: Global Collateral: How Financial Innovation Drives Capital Flows and Increases Financial Instability
Abstract: We show that cross-border financial flows arise when levels of financial innovation differ across countries. Financial integration is a way of sharing scarce collateral. The ability of one country to leverage and tranche assets provides attractive financial contracts to investors in the other country, and general equilibrium effects on prices create opportunities for investors in the sophisticated country to invest abroad. Foreign demand for collateral and for collateral-backed financial promises increases the collateral value of domestic assets, and cheap foreign assets provide attractive returns to investors who do not demand collateral to issue promises. Gross global flows respond dynamically to fundamentals, exporting and amplifying financial volatility.

Title: Hyperbolic Discounting and Life-Cycle Portfolio Choice
Abstract: This paper studies how hyperbolic discounting affects stock market participation, asset allocation, and saving decisions over the life cycle in an economy with Epstein-Zin preferences. Hyperbolic discounting affects saving and portfolio decisions through at least two channels: (1) it lowers desired saving, which decreases financial wealth relative to future earnings; and (2) it lowers the incentive to pay a fixed cost to enter the stock market. We find that hyperbolic discounters accumulate less wealth relative to their geometric counterparts and that they participate in the stock market at a later age. Because they have lower levels of financial wealth relative to future earnings, hyperbolic discounters who do participate in the stock market tend to hold a higher share of equities, particularly in the retirement years. We find that increasing the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, holding risk aversion constant, greatly magnifies the impact of hyperbolic discounting on all of the model's decision rules and simulated levels of participation, allocation, and wealth. Finally, we introduce endogenous financial knowledge accumulation and find that hyperbolic discounting leads to lower financial literacy and inefficient stock market investment.

Title: On the Robustness of Theoretical Asset Pricing Models
Abstract: We derive a parsimonious returns-based stochastic discount factor that is robust to model misspecification. We consider a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents who can invest their wealth in many assets. As long as (i) agents have (individual-, time-, and state-dependent) recursive preferences that are homothetic in current consumption and continuation value with a common relative risk aversion coefficient "gamma" and (ii) asset returns and individual state variables are conditionally independent (e.g., GARCH processes), we prove that the (minus "gamma")-th power of market return is a valid stochastic discount factor. Within this class of models, asset prices are determined by relative risk aversion and technology alone, and "returns-based asset pricing" is robust to model misspecification as opposed to the consumption-based approach. We recast the equity premium puzzle as a consumption/saving puzzle, not as an asset pricing puzzle.

Title: Policies with Varying Costs and Benefits: A Land Conservation Classroom Game
Abstract: Some policies try to maximize net benefits by targeting different individuals to participate. This is difficult when costs and benefits of participation vary independently, as they do in land conservation. We share a classroom game that explores cases in which minimizing costs may not maximize benefits and vice versa. This game is a contextually rich pedagogical tool, putting students in the role of landowners who must decide whether to conserve land in different policy environments: flat conservation payments, agglomeration bonuses, and a conservation auction. Students learn about specific issues in land conservation, ecosystem services, preferences for non-money outcomes, and general issues in policymaking. The game is suited to classes in environmental, resource, agricultural, and policy economics, and more general classes in microeconomics and public policy.

Title: The Nature of Conflict
Abstract: This research establishes that the emergence, prevalence, recurrence, and severity of intrastate conflicts in the modern era reflect the long shadow of prehistory. Exploiting variations across national populations, it demonstrates that genetic diversity, as determined predominantly during the exodus of humans from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, has contributed significantly to the frequency, incidence, and onset of both overall and ethnic civil conflict over the last half-century, accounting for a large set of geographical and institutional correlates of conflict, as well as measures of economic development. Furthermore, the analysis establishes the significant contribution of genetic diversity to the intensity of social unrest and to the incidence of intragroup factional conflict. These findings arguably reflect the contribution of genetic diversity to the degree of fractionalization and polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups in the national population; the adverse influence of genetic diversity on interpersonal trust and cooperation; the contribution of genetic diversity to divergence in preferences for public goods and redistributive policies; and the potential impact of genetic diversity on economic inequality within a society.

Title: Climatic Fluctuations and the Diffusion of Agriculture
Abstract: This research examines the climatic origins of the diffusion of Neolithic agriculture across countries and archaeological sites. The theory suggests that a foraging society's history of climatic shocks shaped the timing of its adoption of farming. Specifically, as long as climatic disturbances did not lead to a collapse of the underlying resource base, the rate at which hunter-gatherers were climatically propelled to experiment with their habitats determined the accumulation of tacit knowledge complementary to farming. Consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the empirical investigation demonstrates that, conditional on biogeographic endowments, climatic volatility has a hump-shaped effect on the timing of the adoption of agriculture.

Title: Genetic Diversity and the Origins of Cultural Fragmentation
Abstract: Despite the importance attributed to the effects of diversity on the stability and prosperity of nations, the origins of the uneven distribution of ethnic and cultural fragmentation across countries have been underexplored. Building on the role of deeply-rooted biogeographical forces in comparative development, this research empirically demonstrates that genetic diversity, predominantly determined during the prehistoric "out of Africa" migration of humans, is an underlying cause of various existing manifestations of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. Further exploration of this uncharted territory may revolutionize the understanding of the effects of deeply-rooted factors on economic development and the composition of human capital across the globe.

Title: English Proficiency and Labor Market Performance: Evidence from the Economics Profession
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the global spread of the English language provides an inherent advantage to native English speakers. This question is studied within the context of the economics profession, where the impact of being a native English speaker on future publishing success is examined. English speakers may have an advantage since they are writing in their native language, the quality of writing is a crucial determinant of publishing success, and all the top economics journals are published in English. Using a ranking of the world's top 2.5% of economists, this paper confirms that native English speakers are ranked 100 spots higher (better) than similar non-native English speakers. A variety of extensions examine and dispel other potential explanations.

Title: Income Effects in Labor Supply: Evidence from Child-Related Tax Benefits
Abstract: A parent whose child is born in December can claim child-related tax benefits when she files her tax return a few months later. Parents of children born in January must wait more than a year before they can receive child-related tax benefits. As a result, families with December births have higher after-tax income in the first year of a child's life than otherwise similar families with January births. This paper estimates the corresponding income effect on maternal labor supply, testing whether mothers who give birth in December work and earn less in the months following birth. We use data from the American Community Survey, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, and the 2000 Decennial Census. We find that December mothers have a lower probability of working, particularly in the third month after a child's birth. Earnings data from the SIPP indicate that an additional dollar of child-related tax benefits reduces annual maternal earnings in the year following a child's birth by approximately one dollar.

Abstract: This paper uses a general equilibrium model with collateralized borrowing to show that increases in risk can have ambiguous effects on leverage, loan margins, loan amounts, and asset prices. Increasing risk about future payoffs and endowments can lead to riskier loans with larger balances and lower spreads even when lenders are risk-averse and borrowers can default. As well, increasing the covariance of either agents' endowments with the asset payoff can have ambiguous consequences for equilibrium. Though the effects are ambiguous, key determinants of how increased risk translate into changes in prices and allocations are the correlation of agents' endowments with the asset payoff, agents' risk aversion, and the location of increased risk in the distribution of future states. Some restricted changes in the borrower's or lender's endowments can have unambiguous but asymmetric effects on equilibrium.

Title: Financial Intermediation, Leverage, and Macroeconomic Instability
Abstract: This paper investigates how financial-sector leverage affects macroeconomic instability and welfare. In the model, banks borrow (use leverage) to allocate resources to productive projects and provide liquidity. When banks do not actively issue new equity, aggregate outcomes depend on the level of equity in the financial sector. Equilibrium is inefficient because agents do not internalize how their decisions affect volatility, aggregate leverage, and the returns on assets. Leverage creates systemic risk, which increases the frequency and duration of crises. Limiting leverage decreases asset-price volatility and increases expected returns, which decrease the likelihood that the financial sector is undercapitalized.

Title: Correlated Default and Financial Intermediation
Abstract: Financial intermediation naturally arises when knowledge about the aggregate state is valuable for managing investments and lenders cannot easily observe the aggregate state. I show this using a costly enforcement model in which lenders need ex-post incentives to enforce payments from defaulted loans and borrowers' payoffs are correlated. When projects have correlated outcomes, learning the state of one project (via enforcement) provides information about the states of other projects. A large, correlated portfolio provides ex-post incentives for enforcement; as a result, intermediation dominates direct lending, intermediaries are financed with risk-free deposits, earn positive profits, and hold systemic default risk.

Title: Evidence on the Responsiveness of Export-Related VAT Evasion to VAT Rates in the EU
Abstract: In almost all countries that operate a value-added tax (VAT), the VAT "zero-rates" exports, meaning that exporting firms can claim credit for VAT on their inputs, but pay no VAT on sales of exports. This is necessary when the goal is to make the base of the tax domestic consumption. A consequence is that firms can reduce their tax burdens by misreporting some of their sales to domestic consumers as exports. In principle, reported exports from country i to country j should match up with reported imports into country j from country i, except for measurement errors, and costs of insurance and freight that are included in import value but not export value. VAT evasion can be another source of discrepancy which would tend to cause reported exports to exceed reported imports for trade flows in the same direction. We use data on such discrepancies in trade flows between pairs of European Union member countries during 1984 through 2011 to infer whether higher VAT rates are associated with greater over-reporting of exports. A difference-in-differences identification strategy, exploiting the fact that VAT rates changed in different ways over time in different countries, suggests that each percentage point increase in the exporting countryâ€™s standard VAT rate increases the discrepancy of exports over imports by about 1.1 percent of exports. For the typical EU-15 country, this implies that at the margin, about 15 percent of the static revenue gain from a VAT rate increase would be lost due to this particular channel for VAT evasion.

Title: Fatal Attraction: health care agglomeration and its consequences.
Abstract: In this paper we focus on a fundamental tension between the economies of agglomeration available to health care organizations and the impacts of spatial concentration of health care organizations on overall health outcomes.
We identify plausible measures of health care concentration and dispersion, and adapt them to the US urban context. We calculate these measures for nonprofit health organizations for all US metropolitan areas from 1989 to 2009. We use these data to test for signs that agglomeration economies are important for these organizations.
We use mortality rates to serve as an indicator of health outcomes, and provide an analysis of the impacts of agglomeration on health outcomes in US cities. This analysis highlights some disturbing results. The analysis suggests that health care organizations in US cities are more clustered than desirable for achieving the best health outcomes.

Title: Culture Concentration
Abstract: Many cities contain local agglomerations of cultural organizations. The "Museum Mile" portion of 5th Avenue in New York, the Museumplein in Amsterdam, Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London are famous examples, and there are hundreds of others large and small. These clusters may arise for some of the same reasons that other agglomerations occur, although the cultural organizations that comprise them have more complex objective functions than the profit-maximizing firms whose agglomeration is more frequently studied. In this paper we assemble micro-geographic data on cultural non-profits in US urban areas from 1989 through 2009. We calculate several indices of concentration and dispersion, and assemble a panel data set to explore the impact of these concentrations on local economic well-being. We also present evidence consistent with a hypothesis that there are real agglomeration economies at work, lowering production costs and permitting a larger number of cultural organizations per capita in urban areas where the organizations are more clustered.

Title: The Good of the Few: Reciprocal Acts and the Provision of a Public Bad
Abstract: People trade favors when doing so increases efficiency. Will they when it reduces efficiency, such as in political logrolling? We introduce the "Stakeholder Public Bad" game, in which common fund contributions increase one personâ€™s earnings (the "Stakeholder") while reducing others' earnings and overall efficiency. The Stakeholder position rotates through all group members or just alternates among two people (making it easier to form a coalition). High Stakeholder rewards provide a lever for reciprocity: if someone contributes when another is Stakeholder, he may be rewarded with a gift when he becomes Stakeholder. Reciprocity is only possible when agents know others' roles and actions, so information provision may be pro- or anti-social. In a laboratory experiment, we combine a rotating or alternating asymmetry in payoffs with varying levels of information provision to examine pro- and anti-social reciprocity. We find that subjects in the Stakeholder role willingly sacrifice social welfare. We also see both anti-social and pro-social favor trading, particularly when coalition-forming is easier. Favor trading does not change the mean level of public bad provision. People who trade favors tend to be less risk averse.

Title: Discovered Preferences for Risky and Non-Risky Goods
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic theory that integrates the discovered preference hypothesis into neoclassical microeconomic choice theory. A theory in which preferences must be discovered through experience can explain patterns observed in choice data, including preference reversals, evolution of or instability in risky choice, and errors that decline with repetition as seen in contingent valuation data. With reasonable assumptions, we show that preferences for common, high-ranked, and non-stochastic choice items are learned quickly and thus should appear stable. However, initially low-ranked choice items may remain persistently mis-ranked. Preferences for choice items with stochastic outcomes are difficult to learn, so choice under uncertainty is subject to error. At finite time, a choice item is more likely to be mis-ranked if it has stochastic outcomes, if it is initially low-ranked, or if it appears rarely in choice sets. The existence of a default option may or may not render correct ranking more difficult. Undiscovered preferences can lead to real welfare loss as agents make choices not congruent with their true preferences. This theory is amenable to tests using laboratory experiments. Preference discovery has implications for policy, and the process of discovery may contaminate choice data in a variety of contexts.

Title: Temporal Spillovers in Land Conservation
Abstract: Temporal spillovers occur when a conservation program changes what happens to land outside the temporal window of the conservation contract. This may happen when conservation improves land so that returns to non-conservation uses are increased, or when landowners' preferences become more pro-conservation as they see land flourish under conservation, for example. These post-contract changes may occur on the extensive margin (acres of land conserved) or intensive margin (intensity of land in a given use). If temporal spillovers exist, benefits from conservation programs estimated by focusing solely on the effects that occur during the conservation contract will overstate or understate the true benefits of the program. I lay out a simple model of temporal spillovers. I test this model in the context of the United States Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). I use a pre-analysis sample specification step to choose counterfactual land most like the CRP land. On the extensive margin, I find that CRP causes some land to be 22-27% more likely to be farmed, potentially offsetting some environmental benefits. However, farmed ex-CRP land is slightly more likely to use a conservation practice. This is a mitigating factor on the intensive margin.

Title: Globalization and Human Capital Investment: How Export Composition Drives Educational Attainment
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the composition of a country's exports is an important driver of educational attainment. Using detailed trade data and a gravity-based IV technique, we identify the causal impact of changes in the pattern of a country's exports on subsequent educational attainment. Relying on within-country variation over forty-five years for more than one hundred countries, our empirical analysis shows that exports of low-skill-intensive goods depresses average years of schooling - particularly at the primary level - while exports of skill-intensive goods increases years of schooling - at higher rungs of the educational ladder. Our results provide new insights into which types of sectoral growth are most beneficial for long-term human capital formation and suggest that trade can exacerbate initial differences in factor endowments across countries.

Title: Staffing Subsidies and the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes
Abstract: Concerns about the quality of state-financed nursing home care has led to the wide-scale adoption by states of pass-through subsidies, in which Medicaid reimbursement rates are directly tied to staffing expenditure. We examine the effects of Medicaid pass-through on nursing home staffing and quality of care by adapting a two-step FGLS method that addresses clustering and state-level temporal autocorrelation. We find that pass-through increases staffing by 4.4% in higher quality nursing homes and improves quality of care in lower quality nursing homes by an amount equivalent to one sixth the inter-quartile range of the quality distribution.

Title: Russian Peasants and Politicians: The Political Economy of Local Agricultural Support in Nizhnii Novgorod Province, 1864-1914
Abstract: This paper explores the local political economy of early agronomic efforts in Tsarist Russia by undertaking a two-part analysis of the role of the zemstvo Â– a 19th century institution of local self-government Â– in improving local agricultural conditions. First, we investigate the agronomic activities of various levels of government in Russia over the last fifty years of the Tsarist era. After discussing the relatively limited role played by the central ministries and peasant institutions of self-government, we follow Nafziger (2011) in undertaking a qualitative and cross-district empirical analysis of how variation in economic conditions and the political structure of the zemstvo assemblies may have motivated zemstvo expenditures on agriculture. This exercise finds evidence suggesting that the peasantry Â– the population most likely affected by agronomic efforts Â– had an influence on the policies of the zemstvo, despite rarely holding majority positions in the assemblies. To explore the mechanisms underlying these results, we turn to a case study of agricultural development and zemstvo policies in Nizhnii Novgorod province. We draw on archival records, contemporary publications, and newspaper accounts to document these factors, both at the provincial level and for one relatively non-agricultural district (Semenov). Our findings suggest that the policy preferences of the local elites and of leaders of the executive committees of the institution likely mattered more than the composition of the zemstvo assembly for the resulting outcomes. By shedding light on the political mechanisms behind local public support for agronomic efforts, this chapter makes an initial step towards a fuller account of the early stages of Russia's agrarian transformation.

Title: Russian Serfdom, Emancipation, and Land Inequality: New Evidence
Abstract: Serfdom is often viewed as a major institutional constraint on the economic development of Tsarist Russia, one that persisted well after emancipation occurred in 1861 through the ways that property rights were transferred to the peasantry. However, scholars have generally asserted this causal relationship with few facts in hand. This paper introduces a variety of newly collected data, covering European Russia at the district (uezd) level, to describe serfdom, emancipation, and the subsequent evolution of land holdings among the rural population into the 20th century. A series of simple empirical exercises describes several important ways that the institution of serfdom varied across European Russia; outlines how the emancipation reforms differentially affected the minority of privately owned serfs relative to the majority of other types of peasants; and connects these differences to long-run variation in land ownership, obligations, and inequality. The evidence explored in this paper constitutes the groundwork for considering the possible channels linking the demise of serfdom to Russia's slow pace of economic growth prior to the Bolshevik Revolution.

Title: Russian Inequality on the Eve of Revolution
Abstract: Just how unequal were the incomes of different classes of Russians on the eve of
 Revolution, relative to other countries, to Russia's earlier history, and to Russia's income
 distribution today? Careful weighing of an eclectic data set provides provisional
 answers. In 1904, on the eve of military defeat and the 1905 Revolution, Russian income
 inequality was middling by the standards of that era, and less severe than inequality has
 become today in such countries as China, the United States, and Russia itself. We enrich
 this emerging story by noting some distinctive fiscal and relative-price features of
 Imperial Russia. We hope that this report sets the stage for comparisons to Russian
 before the serf Emancipation of 1861.

Title: How Inflation Affects Macroeconomic Performance: An Agent-Based Computational Investigation
Abstract: We use an agent-based computational approach to show how inflation can worsen macroeconomic performance by disrupting the mechanism of exchange in a decentralized market economy. We find that, in our model economy, increasing the trend rate of inflation above 3 percent has a substantial deleterious effect, but lowering it below 3 percent has no significant macroeconomic consequences. Our finding remains qualitatively robust to changes in parameter values and to modifications to our model that partly address the Lucas critique. Finally, we contribute a novel explanation for why cross-country regressions may fail to detect a significant negative effect of trend inflation on output even when such an effect exists in reality.

Title: The Effect of Fertility Reduction on Economic Growth
Abstract: We assess quantitatively the effect of exogenous reductions in fertility on output per capita. Our simulation model allows for effects that run through schooling, the size and age structure of the population, capital accumulation, parental time input into child-rearing, and crowding of fixed natural resources. The model is parameterized using a combination of microeconomic estimates and standard components of quantitative macroeconomic theory. We apply the model to examine the effect of a change in fertility from the UN medium-variant to the UN low-variant projection in Nigeria. For a base case set of parameters, we find that such a change would raise output per capita by 5.6 percent at a horizon of 20 years, and by 11.9 percent at a horizon of 50 years.

Title: The "Out of Africa" Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development
Abstract: This research advances and empirically establishes the hypothesis that, in the course of the prehistoric exodus of Homo sapiens out of Africa, variation in migratory distance to various settlements across the globe affected genetic diversity and has had a persistent hump-shaped effect on comparative economic development, reflecting the trade-off between the beneficial and the detrimental effects of diversity on productivity. While the low diversity of Native American populations and the high diversity of African populations have been detrimental for the development of these regions, the intermediate levels of diversity associated with European and Asian populations have been conducive for development.

Title: Those Outsiders: How Downstream Externalities Affect Public Good Provision
Abstract: Some policy problems pit the interests of one group against those of another group. One group may, for example, determine the provision of a project (such as a power plant or a dam) that benefits group members but has downstream externalities that hurt people outside the group. We introduce a model of projects with such asymmetries. In-group members may contribute to a common fund that benefits them as a public good. In the model, benefits from the project may or may not vary within the group. Project provision has negative downstream externalities: common fund contributions hurt agents outside the in-group (Â“OutsidersÂ”) rendering common fund contributions anti-social overall. Many models of social preferences predict that such externalities should reduce or eliminate project provision, although conditional cooperation or a preference for in-group members may counteract this effect. We test this model with a lab experiment. With homogeneous in-group benefits, the presence of negative downstream externalities reduces contribution levels by nearly half. We introduce a rotating high-return position that allows subjects to trade favors. Contributions diminish only slightly with the introduction of the negative externality and reciprocal giving occurs whether or not Outsiders are present.

Title: Reallocating wealth? Insecure property rights and agricultural investment in rural China
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of village-level land reallocations in China on household economic outcomes. Since land was decollectivized in China in 1983, village leaders have implemented regular forced reallocations of land designed to enhance intravillage equity and attain other policy goals. I estimate the impact of insecure tenure using the past history of land shifts as an instrument for current tenure insecurity, and find that an increase in the probability of losing the current plot yields a decrease in agricultural inputs and production of around one standard deviation. Though the costs of insecure tenure are high, structural estimates of the varying cost of reallocation across different villages suggest the choice to reallocate does reflect an optimizing process on the part of village officials, who reallocate where the net benefit is larger. However, the observed pattern of reallocations would be optimal only given an objective function for the village leader that places an extremely high weight on equity, and even given this objective function, there is evidence that village leaders may be making some costly mistakes.

Title: The New Safety Net? Supplemental Security Income after Welfare Reform
Abstract: Over the past twenty years, the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI), which provides federally-funded income support for disabled individuals, has become one of the most important means-tested cash aid programs in the United States. This growth has been accompanied by growing concerns about the nature of the program and its role as a Â“new safety net.Â” In this paper, I use state panel data, exploiting variation both across states and over time, to examine the relationship between welfare reform and SSI disabled caseloads for both adults and children. I also examine whether the relationship between SSI participation and other factors (economic, health-related, and political) has been fundamentally altered in the aftermath of welfare reform. Results suggest that welfare reform significantly increased SSI participation, and changed the relationship between other conditions and SSI participation. Notably, the SSI program has become more responsive to business cycles for women and children since welfare reform.

Title: New Evidence on Taxes and the Timing of Birth
Abstract: This paper uses data from the universe of tax returns filed between 2001 and 2010 to test whether parents shift the timing of childbirth around the New Year to gain tax benefits. Filers have an incentive to shift births from early January into late December, through induction or cesarean delivery, because child-related tax benefits are not prorated. We find evidence of a positive, but very small, effect of tax incentives on birth timing. An additional $1000 of tax benefits increases the probability of a late-December birth by only about 1 percentage point. We argue that the response to tax incentives is small in part because of confusion about eligibility and delays in the issuance of Social Security Numbers for newborns, as well as a lack of control over medical procedures on the part of filers with the highest tax values. We also document a precise shifting of reported self-employment income in response to variation in incentives from the Earned Income Tax Credit due to childbirth. We estimate that this reporting response reduces federal revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

Title: How Income Changes During Unemployment: Evidence from Tax Return Data
Abstract: We use a panel of tax returns spanning 1999 to 2011 to provide new evidence on household experiences during unemployment. Unemployment is associated with roughly a 20% reduction in household wage earnings. Unemployment insurance compensates for half of these wage losses. Households also partially compensate by using a variety of income sources. Distributions from retirement accounts increase in the short run. Self-employment income and disability insurance payments increase over longer periods. More generous UI benefits crowd out wage income and are associated with increased distributions from retirement accounts. This combination of responses is consistent with UI benefits lengthening unemployment spells.

Title: Impact of Corruption on Firm-Level Export Decisions
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of corruption on the self-selection of firms into domestic and export markets. A heterogeneous firm model predicts that corruption decreases the probability that a firm only sells domestically, increases the probability that a firm exports indirectly through an intermediary, and decreases the probability that a firm exports directly. The propositions of the model are tested using a comprehensive data set of over 23,000 firms in 80 developing countries. The results confirm both the self-selection of firms according to their productivity and the anticipated impact of corruption. This indicates that in developing countries where corruption is especially severe, intermediaries provide a crucial link to global markets.

Title: Favor Trading in Public Good Provision
Abstract: Favor trading is common. We do something nice for someone and they do something nice in return. Several motives might underlie such behavior, including altruism, strategic motives, and direct or indirect positive reciprocity. It is not yet well-understood how these fit together to affect behavior, how they interact in various institutional structures, and how they play out over time. We use a laboratory experiment to study the elements and dynamics of favor trading in a particular setting: the private provision of a public good. In our experiment, giving subjects the ability to practice targeted reciprocity by making a simple, low-cost change in information provision increases contributions to the public good by 14%. Subjects reward group members who have previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous group members. Strategic concerns cannot explain all of this behavior, and it must be at least partly due to direct reciprocity. When someone cannot directly benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the public good. People thus excluded from the Â“circle of reciprocityÂ” provide a clean and strict test of indirect reciprocity. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we do not observe indirect reciprocity.

Title: Payments or persuasion: common pool resource management with price and non-price measures
Abstract: We use lab experiments to study policies that address common pool resource overuse. We look at a price mechanism, specifically a Pigouvian subsidy, and four non-price interventions. The non-price policies are information alone, information with a normative message, communication alone, and normative messages with communication allowed. In all experiment sessions, no intervention occurs in the first seven and last seven rounds, allowing us to examine the effects of introducing and taking away a policy. The subsidy leads to near-efficient extraction, but surprisingly leads groups that were not over-extracting to also reduce extraction. This over-compliance decreases efficiency, although on net the subsidy is the most efficiency-enhancing intervention. Information provision, communication, normative appeals, and normative appeals combined with communication all reduce over-extraction (though by less than the subsidy) without exacerbating over-compliance; however, the effects of information alone and communication alone are small and not robust. The non-price policies cause a decline in over-extraction of from 0.549% (information) to 11.441% (normative appeals with communication). These effects are of the same order of magnitude as the effects seen in major field studies of conservation messaging. The subsidy has the worst persistence properties (after the intervention ceases), while normative messages with communication have the best.

Title: Tax Policy and Philanthropy: A Primer on the Evidence for the U.S. and its Implications
Abstract: Tax policies in the U.S. increase the incentive to donate to charity among those who itemize their deductions, and most of the tax
 revenue cost goes to subsidize donations made  by relatively high-income people. Several types of empirical evidence which I review here suggest that the donation behavior of high-income people in particular is probably rather responsive to these tax incentives. Economic theory helps clarify what factors affect the optimal tax subsidy for charitable giving, and I summarize some of the key insights.  Among other things, the theory suggests that the optimal subsidy is likely to be higher when donation behavior is more responsive to tax incentives, but this is just one important piece of a larger puzzle.

Title: How do Immigrants Fare in Retirement
Abstract: The extensive literature documenting differences in wages between immigrants and US-born workers suggests immigrant households may enter retirement at a significant financial disadvantage relative to households headed by the native-born. However, little work has examined differences in retirement resources and retirement security between immigrant and native households. In this paper, we use data from the Health and Retirement Study, linked with restricted data from the Social Security Administration, to compare retirement resources between immigrant and native-born households. Our results suggest that while immigrants have lower levels of Social Security benefits than natives, they have higher levels of private net worth after controlling for education, age, race, and ethnicity. The estimated immigrant differentials vary a great deal by years in the US, with the most recent immigrants the least prepared for retirement.

Title: Educational Tracking, Residential Sorting, and Intergenerational Mobility
Abstract: I examine how student allocation rules impact achievement of students of different ability and socio- economic background. When the assignment rule shifts from exam to district based, a model illustrates that income relative to ability becomes a stronger predictor of student achievement and higher income households sort towards the better school districts. Using evidence from South Korea, I find that the impact of fatherÃ•s education, relative to oneÃ•s middle school grade, on college entrance exam score increases twofold under district assignment. The change in housing land price is 13 percentage points higher in the better school district when the regime shifts.

Title: Estimating Heterogeneous Take-up and Crowd-Out Responses to Current Medicaid Limits and Their Nonmarginal Expansions
Abstract: We use a switching probit model and the income-limit-based structure of Medicaid eligibility for children to estimate treatment effects of Medicaid expansions not found in existing work on public insurance. In particular, we estimate rates of Medicaid take-up, private insurance coverage, and crowd-out for the currently eligible overall and for different demographic groups, and we estimate corresponding rates for children made eligible by a counterfactual nonmarginal increase in the Medicaid income limits. We find strikingly different rates across demographic groups, with individuals in traditionally less disadvantaged groups having a considerably lower response to the coverage for which they are eligible.

Title: Culture Shocks and Consequences: the connection between the arts and urban economic growth
Abstract: Is there a relationship between local arts and culture production and local prosperity that is permanent
rather than transitory? The answer to this question determines whether arts and culture production
generates economic growth or a temporary `multiplier' effect that diminishes over time. We argue that
despite the obvious public policy interest in the subject there has been no fully satisfactory empirical
analysis of this question. In this paper we provide a model that allows us to think systematically about the
problem and an empirical methodology capable of testing relevant hypotheses concerning possible answers
to the question. We identify data to which these methods can be applied, using per capita GDP and
expenditure levels of arts and culture production by not-for-profit organizations in US urban areas. Our
analysis suggests that the impact of arts and culture production is not transitory. Shocks to local arts and
culture production generate impacts that alter the local economy and change steady-state GDP.

Title: Shock to the System: Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and Child Mortality
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of introducing a new HIV/AIDS service, prevention of
 mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), on overall quality of prenatal and postnatal
 care. My results suggest that local PMTCT introduction in Zambia may have actually increased
 all cause child mortality in the short term. There is some evidence that vaccinations
 may have declined in the short term in association with local PMTCT introduction, suggesting
 that the new service may have partly crowded out existing pediatric health services.

Title: The Good of the Few: Reciprocity in the Provision of a Public Bad
Abstract: People have been shown to engage in favor-trading when it is efficiency-enhancing to do so. Will they also trade favors when it reduces efficiency, as in a series of wasteful public projects that each benefits an individual? We introduce the Â“Stakeholder Public BadÂ” game to study this question. In each round, contributions to a common fund increase the earnings of one person (the Â“StakeholderÂ”) but reduce the earnings of the rest of the group so much that overall efficiency is reduced. The Stakeholder position rotates through members of the group and the promise of the high reward associated with this position may enable subjects to behave reciprocally. We hypothesize that some people will help a current Stakeholder by contributing in hopes of being rewarded later with a reciprocal gift. In a lab experiment, we find evidence of such favor trading. We also find that Stakeholders in this situation seem perfectly willing to sacrifice the good of the group to reap their own personal rewards, and this is true even when their contribution decisions are public. While the revelation of information about othersÂ’ actions and roles has previously been shown to enable efficiency-increasing reciprocity, we show that it also enables efficiency-decreasing reciprocal acts. Subjects who are more risk-averse behave in a way that is more myopically self-interested as compared to less risk-averse people when information conditions preclude favor trading, and subjects who identify with the Democratic Party show more restraint when they are Stakeholder than those who do not.

Title: Low Interest Rates and Housing Bubbles: Still No Smoking Gun
Abstract:  This paper revisits the relationship between interest rates and house prices. Surveying a
 number of recent studies and bringing to bear some new evidence on the question, this paper
 argues that in the data, the impact of interest rates on house prices appears to be quite modest.
 Specifically, the estimated effects are uniformly smaller than those implied by the conventional
 user cost theory of house prices, and they are too small to explain the previous decadeÂ’s real
 estate boom in the U.S. and elsewhere. However in some countries, there does appear to have
 been a link between the rapid expansion of the monetary base and growth in house prices and
 housing credit.

Title: Cultural Diversity, Geographical Isolation, and the Origin of the Wealth of Nations
Abstract: This research argues that variations in the interplay between cultural assimilation and cultural diffusion have played a significant role in giving rise to differential patterns of economic development across the globe. Societies that were geographically less vulnerable to cultural diffusion benefited from enhanced assimilation, lower cultural diversity, and more intense accumulation of society-specific human capital. Thus, they operated more efficiently with respect to their production-possibility frontiers and flourished in the technological paradigm that characterized the agricultural stage of development. The lack of cultural diffusion and its manifestation in cultural rigidity, however, diminished the ability of these societies to adapt to a new technological paradigm, which delayed their industrialization and, hence, their take-off to a state of sustained economic growth. The theory thus contributes to the understanding of the advent of divergence and overtaking in the process of development. Consistently with the theory, the empirical analysis establishes that (i) geographical isolation prevalent in pre-industrial times (i.e., prior to the advent of airborne transportation technology) has had a persistent negative impact on the extent of contemporary cultural diversity; (ii) pre-industrial geographical isolation had a positive impact on economic development in the agricultural stage but has had a negative impact on income per capita in the course of industrialization; and (iii) cultural diversity, as determined exogenously by pre-industrial geographical isolation, has had a positive impact on economic development in the process of industrialization.

Title: Is Sex Like Driving? Risk Compensation Associated with Male Circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya
Abstract: Mass adult male circumcision campaigns for HIV prevention are underway across much of
 Sub-Saharan Africa. However, concern remains about risk compensation associated with the
 reduction in the probability of HIV transmission per risky act. This paper examines the be-
 havioral response to male circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya. Contrary to the presumption of risk
 compensation, we find that the response due to the perceived reduction in HIV transmission
 appears to have been a reduction in risky sexual behavior. We suggest a mechanism for this
 finding: circumcision reduces fatalism about acquiring HIV/AIDS and increases the salience
 of the tradeoff between engaging in additional risky behavior and avoiding acquiring HIV. We
 also find what appears to be a competing effect that does not operate through the circumcision
 recipient's belief about the reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV.

Title: Remittances and the Wage Impact of Immigration
Abstract: This paper examines how the outflow of remittances affects the wages of native workers. The model shows that the wage impact of immigration depends on the competing effects of an increase in labor market competition and an increase in the consumer base. Immigrant remittances provide a unique way of isolating this latter effect since they reduce the consumer base but not the workforce. The predictions of the model are tested using an unusually rich German data set that has detailed information on remittances and wages. As expected, the results indicate that a one percent increase in remittances depress the wages of native workers by 0.06%. Furthermore, remittances predominantly affect workers in non-traded industries that are more reliant on domestic consumption.

Title: A Shared Sense of Responsibility: Money Versus Effort Contributions in the Vountary Provision of Public Goods
Abstract: A frequently cited argument against the use of market-based instruments to provide public goods is that they diminish our sense of responsibility to be good citizens. In this
  paper, we report on the results of a laboratory experiment designed to explore the idea that this distrust stems from the ability of some members of society to contribute to the public good with money instead of time or effort. We look at how the personal effort exerted by subjects changes when their peers take advantage of an offer to buy out of their obligation to perform lab tasks that contribute toward carbon emission reductions. We find that on average subjects reduce their effort when their peers buy out. However, the aggregate result masks significant heterogeneity across individual responses. Those who choose not to buy out despite its expected profitability have no response to the treatment while those for whom it would simply not be profitable to buy out register large reductions in effort. The magnitude of these responses is increasing in the share of the group that accepts the buyout offer, suggesting that it is the act of peers buying out rather than the simple introduction of monetary incentives that is the source of the effect.

Title: Fertility Responses to Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV
Abstract: Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions reduce the cumulative probability of transmission from a HIV positive woman to her child by as much as 40
 percentage points. This paper is the first economic analysis of the behavioral effects of PMTCT. I examine fertility responses to the scale-up of PMTCT in Zambia, a country where approximately 15 percent of adults age 15-49 are HIV positive. My results suggest that the local introduction of PMTCT reduced pregnancy rates by up to 20 percent, that the fertility response was greater among women who were more likely to be HIV positive, and that PMTCT substantially increased breastfeeding rates.

Title: How Flexible Can Inflation Targeting Be and Still Work?
Abstract:  This paper takes up the issue of the flexibility of inflation targeting regimes, with the specific goal of determining whether the monetary policy of the Bank of England, which
 has a formal inflation target, has been any less flexible than that of the Federal Reserve, which does not have such a target. The empirical analysis uses the speed of inflation forecast convergence, estimated from professional forecastersÂ’ predictions at successive forecast horizons, to gauge the perceived flexibility of the central bankÂ’s response to macroeconomic shocks. Based on this criterion, there is no evidence to suggest that the Bank of EnglandÂ’s inflation target has compelled it to be more aggressive in pursuit of low inflation than the Federal Reserve.

Title: Asymmetric Information and the Foreign-Exchange Trades of Global Custody Banks
Abstract:  This paper provides the first rigorous empirical analysis of markups on custodial foreign exchange trades. It finds that they substantially exceed relevant benchmarks such as
 interbank half-spreads. We trace this to an information asymmetry -- custodial bank dealers know more about their prices and bid-ask spreads than their client funds. We also examine the asset managersÂ’ continued heavy reliance on this high-cost approach to trading when alternatives are available with lower markups. We provide evidence that this choice does not reflect ignorance of the cost differential. Analysis relies on the complete foreign exchange
trading record of a mid-sized global custody bank during calendar year 2006.

Title: The EITC, Tax Refunds, and Unemployment Spells
Abstract:  The Earned Income Tax Credit generates large average tax refunds
 for low-income parents, and these refunds are distributed in a narrow
 time frame. I rely on this plausibly exogenous source of variation in
 liquidity to investigate the effect of cash-on-hand on unemployment duration.
 Among EITC-eligible women, unemployment spells beginning
 just after tax refund receipt last longer than unemployment spells beginning
 at other times of year. There is no evidence that tax refund
 receipt is associated with longer unemployment duration for men, or
 that the longer durations for women are associated with higher-quality
 subsequent job matches.

Title: Micro-Perspectives on Living Standards in Nineteenth-Century Russia
Abstract: In recent years economic historians have turned new attention to questions about standards of
 living in pre-revolutionary Russia. However, most of the studies to date have focused on a
 narrow range of measures for predominantly urban areas. We expand on the existing
 literature with a micro-level analysis, which employs a broader set of measures of wellbeing
 for a small rural region in central Russia. Our findings suggest that living standards were
 improving over the nineteenth century, even in such seemingly less dynamic rural areas.
 Income and consumption patterns, human capital development, and the distribution of
 resources in the countryside were more variegated than a Â‘subsistenceÂ’ approach has typically
 allowed. The micro-level context presented here suggests that state and local institutions
 should be emphasized in future analyses of rural living standards in pre-Soviet Russia.

Title: Big BRICs, Weak Foundations: The Beginning of Public Elementary Education in Brazil, Russia, India, and China
Abstract: Our paper provides a comparative perspective on the development of public primary education in
 four of the largest developing economies circa 1910: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).
 These four countries encompassed more than 50 percent of the worldÂ’s population in 1910, but
 remarkably few of their citizens attended any school by the early 20th century. We present new,
 comparable data on school inputs and outputs for BRIC drawn from contemporary surveys and
 government documents. Recent studies emphasize the importance of political decentralization,
 and relatively broad political voice for the early spread of public primary education in developed
 economies. We identify the former and the lack of the latter to be important in the context of
 BRIC, but we also outline how other factors such as factor endowments, colonialism, serfdom,
 and, especially, the characteristics of the political and economic elite help explain the low
 achievement levels of these four countries and the incredible amount of heterogeneity within
 each of them.

Title: The Value of Honesty: Empirical Estimates from the Case of the Missing Children
Abstract:  How much are people willing to forego to be honest, to follow the rules? When people do break
 the rules, what can standard data sources tell us about their behavior? Standard economic models
 of crime typically assume that individuals are indifferent to dishonesty, so that they will cheat or lie
 as long as the expected pecuniary benefits exceed the expected costs of being caught and punished.
 We investigate this presumption by studying the response to a change in tax reporting rules that
 made it much more difficult for taxpayers to evade taxes by inappropriately claiming additional dependents.
 The policy reform induced a substantial reduction in the number of dependents claimed,
 which indicates that many filers had been cheating before the reform. Yet, the number of filers who
 availed themselves of this evasion opportunity is dwarfed by the number of filers who passed up
 substantial tax savings by not claiming extra dependents. By declining the opportunity to cheat,
 these taxpayers reveal information about their willingness to pay to be honest. We present a novel
 method for inferring the characteristics of taxpayers in the absence of audit data. Our analysis suggests
 both that this willingness to pay to be honest is large on average and that it varies significantly
 across the population of taxpayers.

Title: Monetary Policy and Asset Price Volatility: Should We Refill the Bernanke-Gertler Prescription?
Abstract:  Bernanke and GertlerÂ’s influential 1999 article Â“Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary PolicyÂ” made the case that monetary policy should respond to asset prices only to the extent
 that they have implications for future inflation. This paper revisits that prescription in light of the 2007Â–09 financial crisis. After reviewing the Bernanke-Gertler logic, the paper surveys the recent evolution of views on the appropriate policy response to asset price fluctuations, and discusses the conditions under which a proactive policy would be justified. There is almost no discernible relationship between interest rates and stock and property prices across countries during the years leading up to the crisis, however. While a theoretical case could be made to give some weight to financial stability in setting monetary policy, the evidence presented in the paper suggests that incremental interest rate adjustments are unlikely to be effective in restraining excessive asset price appreciation.

Title: Banks, Market Organization, and Macroeconomic Performance: An Agent-Based Computational Analysis
Abstract: This paper is an exploratory analysis of the role that banks play in supporting what Jevons called the "mechanism of exchange." It considers a model economy in which exchange activities are facilitated and coordinated by a self-organizing network of entrepreneurial trading firms. Collectively, these firms play the part of the Walrasian auctioneer, matching buyers with sellers and helping the economy to reach prices at which peoples' trading plans are mutually compatible. Banks affect macroeconomic performance in this economy because their lending activities facilitate the entry and influence the exit decisions of trading firms. Both entry and exit have ambiguous effects on performance, and we resort to computational analysis to understand how they are resolved. Our analysis draws an important distinction between normal and worst-case scenarios, with the economy experiencing systemic breakdowns in the latter. We show that banks can provide a "financial stabilizer" that more than counteracts the familiar financial accelerator, and that the stabilizing role of the banking system is particularly apparent in worst-case scenarios. In line with this result, we also find that under less restrictive lending standards banks are able to more effectively improve macroeconomic performance in the worst-case scenarios.

Title: A Race to the Bottom? Employment Protection and Foreign Direct Investment
Abstract: A common critique of globalization is that it leads to a race to the bottom. SpeciÂ…cally, it is assumed that multinationals invest in countries with lower regulatory standards and that countries competitively undercut each other's standards in order to attract foreign capital. This paper tests this hypothesis and finds robust empirical support for both predictions. First, a reduction in employment protection rules leads to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). Furthermore, changes in employment protection legislation have a larger impact on the relatively mobile types of FDI. Second, there is evidence that countries are competitively undercutting each other's labor market standards.

Title: Land and Law in Colonial India
Abstract:  The East India CompanyÂ’s conquest of various territories in India typically brought one
 issue to the forefront right away: How would land taxes, the principal source of governmental
 revenue, be collected? But taxation was not a thing unto itself; it was inextricably linked
 with Â“ownershipÂ” and indeed with the entire structure of land rights. For this reason, among
 others, the Company also created/adapted legal systems that would adjudicate the disputes
 that, inevitably, followed in the wake of its land-rights interventions. The legal and land
 tenure arrangements chosen also affected credit markets: to the extent land ownership is
 secure and transferable, land can be used as collateral, or seized in lieu of repayment of debts
 or other contractual obligations. Land, law, and credit in colonial India generated a huge (and
 ongoing) discussion: debates preceding policy choices; later commentary within the colonial
 administration; Â“nationalistÂ” criticisms from the late 19th century onwards; and current
 research linking present-day economic outcomes to colonial era choices. In this paper we
 provide an overview of this literature, focusing on the period 1765-1900. In the interest of
 brevity and coherence we focus two regions, Bengal, which was first conquered (1757-64),
 and the Bombay Deccan, which was annexed in 1818, though we make references to other
 regions as well.

Title: Antiretroviral Therapy and Demand for HIV Testing: Evidence from Zambia
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on demand for
 HIV testing and of ART-induced testing on demand for risky sexual behavior. I provide
 a model of sexual behavior decision-making under uncertainty and estimate the
 structural parameters of the model using nationally representative survey data from
 Zambia on HIV testing decisions before and after the introduction of ART. The empirical
 results indicate that although the introduction of ART increased demand for HIV
 testing, the ART allocation process limited the prevention benefit of ART-induced testing.
 Simulation results show that eliminating this prevention inefficiency while holding
 the supply of ART constant would increase the prevention impact of ART-induced testing
 more than four-fold. More generally, the analysis indicates that existing studies
 which examine "universal" testing or quasi-experimental testing programs understate
 the efficacy of standard voluntary counseling and testing programs.

Title: Jobs and Income Growth of Top Earners and the Causes of Changing Income Inequality: Evidence from U.S. Tax Return Data
Abstract: This paper presents summary statistics on the occupations of taxpayers in the top
 percentile of the national income distribution and fractiles thereof, as well as the
 patterns of real income growth between 1979 and 2005 for top earners in each
 occupation, based on information reported on U.S. individual income tax returns. The
 data demonstrate that executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals
 account for about 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners in recent years, and
 can account for 70 percent of the increase in the share of national income going to the
 top 0.1 percent of the income distribution between 1979 and 2005. During 1979-2005
 there was substantial heterogeneity in growth rates of income for top earners across
 occupations, and significant divergence in incomes within occupations among people in
 the top 1 percent. We consider the implications for various competing explanations for
 the substantial changes in income inequality that have occurred in the U.S. in recent
 times. We then use panel data on U.S. tax returns spanning the years 1987 through
 2005, to estimate the elasticity of gross income with respect to net-of-tax share (that is,
 one minus the marginal tax rate). Information on occupation allows us to control for
 other influences on income in a flexible way using interactions among occupation,
 position in the income distribution, stock prices, housing prices, and the business cycle.
 We also allow for income shifting across years in response to anticipated tax changes, for
 the long-run effect of a tax reform to differ from the short-run effects, for heterogeneous
 mean-reversion across incomes, and for heterogeneous elasticities across income classes.
 In a specification that does all this, we estimate a significant elasticity of 0.7 among
 taxpayers in the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution. Outside of the top 0.1
 percent of the income distribution, we find no conclusive evidence of a positive elasticity
 of income with respect to net-of-tax shares. We find that the estimate for the top 0.1
 percent is not robust to controlling for a spline in lagged income that is very flexible at
 the upper reaches of the income distribution, suggesting that the method used to allow
 for income dynamics is very important. Allowing for income shifting across years in
 response to anticipated tax changes has important consequences for the estimates.

Title: Economic Booms and Risky Sexual Behavior: Evidence from Zambian Copper Mining Cities
Abstract: Existing studies suggest that individual and household level economic shocks affect the demand for and supply of risky sex. However, little evidence exists on the effects of an
 aggregate shock on equilibrium risky sexual behavior. This paper examines the effects of the early twenty-first century copper boom on risky sexual behavior in Zambian copper mining cities. The results indicate that the copper boom substantially reduced rates of transactional sex and multiple partnerships in copper mining cities. These effects were partly concentrated among young adults and copper boom induced in-migration to mining cities appears to have contributed to these reductions.

Title: Identity and Mobility: Historical Fractionalization, Parochial Institutions, and Occupational Choice in the American Midwest
Abstract: This paper examines the role played by identity, or a sense of belonging to a home
 community, in determining occupational choice and mobility. The analysis links competition between
 migrant networks in the Midwest when it was rst developing, and the in-group identity that emerged
 endogenously to support these networks, to institutional participation and occupational choice today.
 Individuals born in counties with greater ethnic fractionalization in 1860, where identity was more
 likely to have emerged, are (i) significantly more likely to participate in institutions such as churches
 and parochial schools that transmit identity from one generation to the next, and (ii) significantly less
 likely to select into mobile skilled occupations 150 years later. The effect of historical fractionalization
 on participation in these socializing institutions actually grows stronger over the course of the twentieth century,
 emphasizing the idea that small initial differences in identity can have large long-term effects on institutions
 and economic choices.

Title: Favor Trading in Public Good Provision
Abstract: Grassroots fundraising leverages favor trading in social networks to support the provision of a public good.
 We use a laboratory experiment to study the elements and dynamics of this type of institution.
  Peer-to-peer reciprocity is important, and having the ability to practice targeted reciprocity
  in our experiment increases contributions to the public good by 14%. Subjects reward group members
  who have previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous group members.
  When someone is rendered unable to benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the public
  good than he does in other settings. People thus excluded from the Â“circle of givingÂ” provide a clean
  and strict test of indirect reciprocity, since they cannot benefit from a norm of cooperation.
  Contrary to previous studies, we do not observe indirect reciprocity.

Title: Real Exchange Rates, Saving and Growth: Is there a Link?
Abstract:  The view that policies directed at the real exchange rate can have an
 important effect on economic growth has been gaining adherents in recent years. Unlike
 the traditional Â“misalignment" view that temporary departures of the real
 exchange rate from its equilibrium level harm growth by distorting a key relative
 price in the economy, the recent literature stresses the growth effects of the
 equilibrium real exchange rate itself, with the claim being that a depreciated
 equilibrium real exchange rate promotes economic growth. While there is no
 consensus on the precise channels through which this effect is generated, an
 increasingly common view in policy circles points to saving as the channel of
 transmission, with the claim that a depreciated real exchange rate raises the
 domestic saving rate -- which in turn stimulates growth by increasing the rate of
 capital accumulation. This paper offers a preliminary exploration of this claim.
 Drawing from standard analytical models, stylized facts on saving and real
 exchange rates, and existing empirical research on saving determinants, the
 paper assesses the link between the real exchange rate and saving. Overall, the
 conclusion is that saving is unlikely to provide the mechanism through which the
 real exchange rate affects growth.

Title: Do Worker Remittances Reduce Output Volatility in Developing Countries?
Abstract:  Remittance inflows have increased considerably in recent years and are large
 relative to the size of many recipient economies. The theoretical and empirical
 effects of remittance inflows on output growth volatility are, however, ambiguous. On
 the one hand, remittances have been a remarkably stable source of income, relative to
 other private and public flows, and they seem to be compensatory in nature, rising
 when the home countryÂ’s economy suffers a downturn. On the other hand, the labor
 supply effects induced by altruistic remittances could cause the output effects
 associated with technology shocks to be magnified. This paper finds robust evidence
 for a sample of 70 remittance-recipient countries, including 16 advanced economies and
 54 developing countries that remittances have a negative effect on output growth
 volatility, thereby supporting the notion that remittance flows are a stabilizing
 influence on output.

Title: Globalization and Investment in Human Capital
Abstract: Workers are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact that globalization has on their domestic labor market. While existing research typically focuses on the effects on labor market outcomes such as wages and employment, we examine whether American workers respond to globalization by increasing their investment in human capital. Specifically, we measure the extent to which offshoring and immigration affect enrollment at institutions of higher education. The results indicate that both offshoring and immigration increase enrollment at community colleges, particularly among older students. We conclude that workers in the U.S. are responding to offshoring and immigration by acquiring the skills necessary to compete in a global economy.

Title: The Great Recession, 'Rainy Day' Funds, and Countercyclical Fiscal Policy in Latin America
Abstract:  This paper examines the fiscal policy options that were available to Latin
 American countries at the onset of the current global economic crisis. It concludes
 that most of the major countries in the region possessed the fiscal space (as measured
 by credible fiscal sustainability and debt headroom) to run prudent countercyclical
 fiscal deficits. For those countries, the appropriate policy response involved a
 constrained fiscal expansion focused on productive public spending and financed by
 drawing on the Â“rainy dayÂ” funds - in the form of large stocks of foreign exchange
 reserves - that they accumulated in prior years, rather than by market borrowing. It
 shows that the recent surge in multilateral financial activity to alleviate market
 illiquidity, whether intended for reserve or budget support, strengthens the case for
 this policy prescription : with multilateral support, the appropriate policy response
 is more expansionary, and its financing is less reliant on market borrowing.

Title: Monetary transmission in low income countries
Abstract:  This paper reviews the monetary transmission mechanism in low income
 countries (LICs).  We use monetary transmission in advanced and emerging markets as a
 benchmark to identify aspects of the transmission mechanism that may operate
 differently in LICs. In particular, we focus on the effects of financial market
 structure on monetary transmission.  The weak institutional framework prevalent in
 LICs drastically reduces the role of securities markets and increases the cost of bank
 lending to private firms. Coupled with imperfect competition in the banking sector,
 this means that banks with chronically high excess reserves invest in domestic public
 bonds or (when possible) in foreign bonds. With the financial system not
 intermediating funds properly, the traditional monetary transmission channels
(interest rate, bank lending, and asset price) are impaired. The exchange rate channel,
 on the other hand, tends to be undermined by central bank intervention in the foreign
 exchange market. These conclusions are supported by review of the institutional
 frameworks, statistical analysis, and previous literature.

Title: Remittances and Institutions: Are Remittances a Curse?
Abstract:  This paper addresses the complex and overlooked relationship between the
 receipt of workersÂ’ remittances and institutional quality in the recipient country.
 Using a simple model, we show how an increase in remittance inflows can lead to
 deterioration of institutional quality Â– specifically, to an increase in the share of
 funds diverted by the government for its own purposes. In a cross section of 111
 countries we empirically verify this proposition and find that a higher ratio of
 remittances to GDP leads to lower indices of control of corruption, government
 effectiveness, and rule of law, even after controlling for potential reverse
 causality.

Title: Workers' Remittances and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate: Theory and Evidence
Abstract:  This paper investigates the impact of workersÂ’ remittances on equilibrium
 real exchange rates (ERER) in recipient economies. Using a small open economy model,
 it shows that standard Â“Dutch DiseaseÂ” results of appreciation are substantially
 weakened or even overturned depending on: degree of openness, factor mobility between
 domestic sectors, and countercyclicality of remittances; the share of consumption in
 tradables; and the sensitivity of a countryÂ’s risk premium to remittance flows. Panel
 integration techniques on a large set of countries provide support for these
 analytical results, and show that ERER appreciation in response to sustained
 remittance flows tends to be quantitatively small.

Title: Immigration and Firm Expansion
Abstract: Research generally focuses on how immigration affects native workers, while the impact of immigration on domestic firms is often overlooked. This paper addresses this important omission by examining whether firms respond to immigration by expanding their production activities within a city in order to utilize the abundant supply of low-skilled workers. Using data on immigration and the universe of establishments in U.S. cities, the results indicate that firms respond to immigration at the extensive margin by increasing the number of establishments. Not surprisingly, immigration has a more positive impact on the number of establishments that are small in size and in relatively mobile, low-skill-intensive industries. Additional evidence indicates that immigration has little impact on employment within existing establishments, the intensive margin, or on the number of establishments in service industries which may expand simply due to immigrant consumption.

Title: Offshoring, Immigration, and the Native Wage Distribution
Abstract: This paper presents a simple model that examines the impact of offshoring and immigration on wages and tests these predictions using U.S. state-industry-year panel data. According to the model, the productivity effect causes offshoring to have a more positive impact on low-skilled wages than immigration, but this gap decreases with the workers' skill level. The empirical results confirm both of these predictions and thus present direct evidence of the productivity effect. Furthermore, the results provide important insight into how specific components of offshoring and immigration affect the wages of particular types of native workers.

Title: Tax Preferences for Higher Education and Adult College Enrollment
Abstract: The federal government delivers substantial college aid through the tax code, after introducing education tax credits in 1998
 and a tuition deduction in 2002. The design of the Lifetime Learning tax credit and the tuition deduction may make them particularly
 useful to older students. This paper investigates how these provisions have affected college attendance of individuals in their 30s and 40s.
 For most adults, there is no effect on college attendance. Among men whose 1998 educational attainment falls short of earlylife educational
 expectations, eligibility for an education tax preference is associated with a 2.5 to 3.4 percentage point increase in the probability of
 college attendance.

Title: Commitment and Conquest: The Case of British Rule in India
Abstract: Contemporary historians usually attribute the East India Company's military success in India to its military strength, and to the mutual distrust of Indian regimes. We argue
  these explanations, though correct, are incomplete. The credibility of the Company's commitments, even though imperfect, was essential to its success.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of relative income on marriage. Accounting flexibly for absolute income,
 the ratio between a manÂ’s income and a local reference group median is a strong predictor of marital status, but only
 for low-income men. Relative income affects marriage even among those living with a partner. A ten percent higher
 reference group income is associated with a two percent reduction in marriage. We propose an identity model to
 explain the results.

Abstract: It has long been recognized that average wages vary strikingly across regions and urban areas, in part due
 to differences in local amenities and fiscal policies. However, analogous differences in wage dispersion
 remain relatively unexplored. We develop a model suggesting that, after accounting for individual
 characteristics, wage dispersion across income groups should reflect differences in the relative valuation
 of local amenities and fiscal policies. We empirically investigate whether there is a link between local
 taxes and expenditures and the degree of dispersion in the wage structure, and find evidence that such a
 relationship exists.

Title: Global Climate Change and the Resurgence of Tropical Disease: An Economic Approach
Abstract: We study the impact of global climate change on the prevalence of tropical
 diseases using a heterogeous agent dynamic general equilibrium model. In
 our framework, households can take actions (e.g., purchasing bednets or other
 goods) that provide partial protection from disease. However, these actions are
 costly and households face borrowing constraints. Parameterizing the model,
 we explore the impact of a worldwide temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius. We find that
 the impact on disease prevalence and especially output should be modest and
 can be mitigated by improvements in protection efficacy.

Title: Implementation of Monetary Policy: How Do Central Banks Set Interest Rates?
Abstract: Central banks no longer set the short-term interest rates that they use for monetary policy
 purposes by manipulating the supply of banking system reserves, as in conventional
 economics textbooks; today this process involves little or no variation in the supply of central
 bank liabilities. In effect, the announcement effect has displaced the liquidity effect
 as the fulcrum of monetary policy implementation. The chapter begins with an exposition
 of the traditional view of the implementation of monetary policy, and an assessment
 of the relationship between the quantity of reserves, appropriately defined, and the level
 of short-term interest rates. Event studies show no relationship between the two for the
 United States, the Euro-system, or Japan. Structural estimates of banksÂ’ reserve demand,
 at a frequency corresponding to the required reserve maintenance period, show no interest
 elasticity for the U.S. or the Euro-system (but some elasticity for Japan). The chapter
 next develops a model of the overnight interest rate setting process incorporating several
 key features of current monetary policy practice, including in particular reserve averaging
 procedures and a commitment, either explicit or implicit, by the central bank to lend or
 absorb reserves in response to differences between the policy interest rate and the corresponding
 target. A key implication is that if reserve demand depends on the difference
 between current and expected future interest rates, but not on the current level per se, then
 the central bank can alter the market-clearing interest rate with no change in reserve supply.
 This implication is borne out in structural estimates of daily reserve demand and supply in
 the U.S.: expected future interest rates shift banksÂ’ reserve demand, while changes in the
 interest rate target are associated with no discernable change in reserve supply. The chapter
 concludes with a discussion of the implementation of monetary policy during the recent
 financial crisis, and the conditions under which the interest rate and the size of the central
 bankÂ’s balance sheet could function as two independent policy instruments.

Title: The Climatic Origins of the Neolithic Revolution: Theory and Evidence
Abstract: This research examines theoretically and empirically the origins of agriculture. The theory highlights the role of climatic sequences as a fundamental determinant of both technological sophistication and population density in a hunter-gatherer regime. It argues that foragers facing volatile environments were forced to take advantage of their geographic endowments at a faster pace. Consequently, as long as climatic shocks preserved the possibility for agriculture, differences in the rate at which foragers were climatically propelled to exploit their habitat determined the comparative evolution of hunter-gatherer societies towards farming. The theory is tested using both cross-country and cross-archaeological site data on the emergence of farming. Consistent with the theory, the empirical analysis demonstrates that, conditional on biogeographic endowments, climatic volatility has a non-monotonic effect on the timing of the transition to agriculture. Farming was undertaken earlier in regions characterized by intermediate levels of climatic volatility, with regions subjected to either too high or too low intertemporal variability transiting later.

Title: Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch
Abstract: This paper examines the central hypothesis of the influential Malthusian theory, according to which improvements in the technological environment during the pre-industrial era had generated only temporary gains in income per capita, eventually leading to a larger, but not significantly richer, population. Exploiting exogenous sources of cross-country variations in land productivity and the level of technological advancement, the analysis demonstrates that, in accordance with the theory, technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living, during the time period 1-1500 CE.

Title: The Earned Income Tax Credit and Reported Self-Employment Income
Abstract: The Earned Income Tax Credit subsidizes earnings from both the wage sector and
 the self-employment sector. This paper uses tax return data to investigate how the EITC
 affects the reporting of self-employment income to the IRS. A difference-in-difference strategy
 is used, considering three expansions in the EITC and comparing changes across filers
 with and without children. The expansions are predicted to increase the reporting of
 self-employment income for those in the phase-in region of the EITC and to reduce the
 reporting of self-employment income for those in the phase-out region. Among the lowest-income
 filers, the 1994 EITC expansion is associated with a significant increase in the
 probability of reporting positive self-employment income, equal to 3.2 percentage points
 for unmarried filers and 4.1 percentage points for married filers.

Title: Safe and Sound Banking: A Role for Countercyclical Regulatory Requirements?
Abstract: Most explanations of the crisis of 2007-2009 emphasize the role of the preceding boom in real estate
 and asset markets in a variety of advanced countries. As a result, an idea that is gaining support among various
 groups is how to make Basel II or any regulatory regime less procyclical. This paper addresses the rationale for and
 likely contribution of such policies. Making provisioning (or capital) requirements countercyclical is one way potentially
 to address procyclicality, and accordingly it looks at the efforts of the authorities in Spain and Colombia, two countries
 in which countercyclical provisioning has been tried, to see what the track record has been. As explained there, these
 experiments have been at best too recent and limited to put much weight on them, but they are much less favorable for
 supporting this practice than is commonly admitted. The paper then addresses concerns and implementation issues with
 countercyclical capital or provisioning requirements, including why their impact might be expected to be limited, and
 concludes with recommendations for developing country officials who want to learn how to make their financial systems
 less exposed to crises.

Title: Financial Regulation in a Changing World: Lessons from the Recent Crisis
Abstract: The current crisis is leading many to re-think the role of finance and how it snew. This paper reviews what was regarded as the
 conventional wisdom on financial regulation prior to the 2007 onset of the crisis, briefly recounts some of the main factors behind the events of
 the 2007-09 years, and then turns to lessons for regulatory reform. At some point in the 1990s, the financial systems of high-income countries
 seemed to be functioning well and withstood some significant shocks, yet by 2007 much had changed. However, the regulatory structure did not change
 in response, and in fact eased in such a way as to exacerbate the instability that was subsequently experienced. A key theme is that financial
 regulation needs to be more dynamic, taking account of financial innovations and how they affect the sector. No such approach to regulation seems
 possible without greater accountability for regulators and attention to the incentives for those in the sector and for those who regulate it.

Title: Learning to Play Nash from the Best
Abstract: I experimentally investigate the effects of the ability to imitate successful others on convergence to the one-shot Nash equilibrium.
 I study a two-player game (Potters and Suetens Forthcoming) in which a single parameter determines the existence of strategic complementarities.
 I generally confirm previous findings when learning from others is not possible: games with strategic complementarities converge more robustly to the
 Nash equilibrium than those without. However, I find the reverse with the ability to learn from successful others as this information significantly
 improves convergence in games without strategic complementarities but has no effect and possibly a negative effect on games with complementarities.

Title: Ambiguous Solicitation: Ambiguous Prescription
Abstract: We conduct a two-phase laboratory experiment, separated by several weeks.  In the first phase, we conduct urn games intended to
 measure ambiguity aversion on a representative population of undergraduate students.  In the second phase, we invite the students back with four
 different solicitation treatments, varying in the ambiguity of information regarding the task and the payout of the laboratory experiment.
 We find that those who return do not differ from the overall pool with respect to their ambiguity version.  However, no solicitation treatment
 generates a representative sample.  The ambiguous task treatment drives away the ambiguity averse disproportionally, and the detailed task treatment
 draws in the ambiguity averse disproportionally.

Title: Behavioral Biases in Annuity Choice: An Experiment
Abstract: We conduct a neutral-context laboratory experiment to systematically investigate the role of the hit-by-bus concern in explaining the
 annuitization puzzle: the low rate of retirement-asset annuitization relative to the predictions of standard models.  We vary endowed asset
 (annuity vs. stock of wealth vs. no explicit endowment), and find a strong endowment effect.  Furthermore, we find that the ordering of survival
 risks matters. Compared to a frame in which a single draw from a known distribution determines survival outcome, annuity choice is lower when
 subjects must sequentially survive early periods to reach periods in which the annuity dominates. We conclude with policy implications.

Title: Democracy Under the Tsars? The Case of the Zemstvo
Abstract: The emancipation of the serfs is often viewed as watershed moment in 19th-century Russian history.
 However, this reform was accompanied by numerous others measures aimed at modernizing the Tsarist economy and
 society. Among these "Great Reforms" was the creation of a new institution of local government - the zemstvo -
 which has received comparatively little attention from economic historians. This quasi-democratic form of local
 government played a large role in expanding the provision of public goods and services in the half century leading
 up to the Russian Revolution. In this paper, I draw on newly collected data from several years of spending and revenue
 decisions by district zemstva. These data are matched to information on local socio-economic conditions to
 produce one of the first (panel) datasets with broad geographic coverage on any topic in Russian economic history.
 I use this dataset to investigate how population characteristics, local economic conditions, and mandated peasant
 representation in the zemstva influenced funding decisions over public goods. Through their representation in this
 local political institution, were peasants able to voice their preferences over spending levels and funding for
 specific initiatives? I find that district zemstvo with greater political representation from the peasantry spent
 more per capita, especially on education. This study initiates a broader research agenda into the zemstvo's place in
 Russian economic history and contributes to the literature on the political economy of public good
 provision in developing societies.

Title: Remain Silent and Ye Shall Suffer: Seller Exploitation of Reticent Buyers in an Experimental Reputation System
Abstract: By providing incentives for sellers to act in a trustworthy manner, reputation mechanisms in many
 online environments can mitigate moral-hazard problems when particular buyers and sellers interact
 infrequently. However, these  mechanisms rely on buyers sharing their private information about sellers
 with the community, and thus may suffer from too little feedback when its provision is costly. In this
 experimental study, we compare a standard feedback mechanism to one in which sellers can inspect a
 buyer's feedback-provision history, thus providing the buyer with incentives to share private information
 even when costly. We find fairly high trust and trustworthiness levels in all markets, with buyers showing
 a willingness to provide costly feedback, especially negative feedback, sufficient to induce seller trustworthiness.
 While we find, ceteris paribus, evidence that the availability of feedback-provision histories increases buyer trust
 by reducing missing feedback, it did not improve overall trustworthiness as this information enabled sellers to
 discriminate and act in a trustworthy manner less frequently with those who share information less frequently.

Title: Pension Freezes and Household Saving Over the Life Cycle
Abstract:  Defined benefit (DB) pension freezes in large healthy firms such as Verizon and
 IBM, as well as terminations of plans in the struggling steel and airline industries,
 highlight the fact that these traditional pensions cannot be viewed as risk-free promises
 from the employeeÂ’s perspective. Indeed, the current turmoil in financial markets and
 difficult economic outlook for many firms suggest that many more pension plans could be
 frozen soon. In this preliminary paper we develop an empirical dynamic programming
 framework to investigate household saving decisions in a model economy with freezeprone
 DB pensions. The model incorporates important sources of uncertainty facing
 households, including asset returns, employment, income, and mortality, as well as
 pension freezes. Applying a compensating variation measure of welfare, we find that
 pension freezes reduce welfare by a maximum of about $6,000 for individuals with a
 high school degree and about $2,000 for individuals with a college degree. We close
 by highlighting a few important issues that are missing from our preliminary analysis,
 including a labor supply decision and the effects of market-clearing conditions in the
 labor market. We hope to address these issues in future work.

Title: Animal genetic resource trade flows: Economic assessment
Abstract:   Throughout human history, livestock producers have relied on a vibrant international exchange of genentic
 resources to achieve improvements in the quality and productivity of their animals. In recent years, however, some
 observers have argued that changes in the legal, technological, and economic environment now imply that international
 exchanges of animal genetic resources (AnGR) systematically benefit rich countries at the expense of poor countries.
 It is argued that international flows of AnGR are displacing the indigenous animal genetic resources of developing
 countries, and alos that the genetic wealth of the developing world is being expropriated by rich countries.
 In reaction, there have been growing calls for limitations and/or barriers to the exchange of animal genetic resources.
 These discussions, however, seem to be based on limited information about the magnitude and direction of current trade
 flows in AnGR. This paper offers an analysis of AnGR trade flows from 1990 to 2005. The paper draws on national-level
 data from 150 countries that reported information to the United States Statistics Division. Three major trade categories
 were evaluated: live cattle and pigs for breeding, and cattle semen. Over the period studied, Europe and North America
 were the primary exporters of genetic resources for the species evaluated. OECD countries accounted for 98.7, 92.5,
 and 95% of cattle semen, live cattle, and swine exports in 2005, respectively. In evaluation the direction of
 trade between developed (North) and developing (South) countries, North-South trade had the largest magnitude,
 followed by North-South, South-South, and South-North. The data do not support the notion that Southern genetic
 resources are being used on a large scale in the North. We believe that importation from South to North is limited
 by the vast discrepancies in production efficiency and production systems between countries in the North and South.
 Given the low volume of South-North exchange, it seems doubtful that sufficient revenues could be acquired through
 a Â“benefit-sharing mechanism" to have any substantial impact on in situ or ex situ conservation efforts, or to generate
 benefits for poor livestock keepers in developing countries. We question whether global agreements or restrictions on trade
 will achieve the improving the well-being of the poor. We suggest that resources instead be urgently employed for conservation
 and that more direct measures should be taken to aid poor farmers, ranchers, and herders in their efforts to conserve genetic resources.

Title: Equipping Immigrants: Migration Flows and Capital Movements
Abstract:  The large current account and capital account imbalances among OECD countries continue to
 attract attention among policy makers and researchers. This paper explores the extent to which
 migration-related capital flows can explain the movements and magnitudes of current and capital
 account imbalances in OECD countries. Migrants must be equipped with machines, and the
 resulting demands for capital are likely, all else being equal, to generate cross-border flows of
 capital. We analyze the empirical predictions of a simple model with endogenous capital and
 labor flows. This model allows for exogenous variation in the supply of capital and labor as well
 as in local production conditions. Empirically, we find that the observed correlation in investment
 rates, capital and labor flows are roughly consistent with a model in which capital is elastically
 supplied at a constant world interest rate, but where the supply of migrants to local economies
 varies exogenously. We then examine how much the increase in net migration rates contributed to
 the increase in the US current account deficit since 1960. Between 1960 and 2000, the US current
 account declined by about 4% of annual GDP. The increase in migration contributed about 1% of
 GDP to this decline.

Title:  Malaria: Disease Impacts and Long-Run Income Differences
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted
 by mosquitoes, causes over 300 million episodes of Â“acute illness" and more than one million deaths annually.
 Most of the deaths occur in poor countries of the tropics, and especially sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the
 countries with high rates of malaria prevalence are also poor, and some researchers have suggested a direct
 link from malaria to poverty. This paper explores the potential impact of malaria on national income levels,
 using a dynamic general equilibrium framework with epidemiological features. We find that if there is no
 feasible prevention or control, malaria can have a significant impact on income levels. However, if people
 have any effective way of avoiding infection, the disease impacts on income levels are likely to be small.
 This is true even where preventive measures are costly.

Title:  Taxes, Wages, and the Labor Supply of Older Americans
Abstract:  Given the aging of the U.S. population, and the greater contributions of older workers to the
 labor force, understanding how policy levers can affect elderly labor supply has become increasingly
 important. In this paper we use data from the Health and Retirement Study linked to state identifiers to
 estimate the responsiveness of the labor supply of older workers to the wage and features of the tax code,
 both on the probability of participating in the labor market, as well as on hours of work for those who choose
 to work. We find that a 10 percent increase in the wage is associated with a five percent increase in
 participation, and we estimate slightly larger responses to marginal tax rates. These results suggest that
 government policies could increase the labor supply of older individuals by changing the returns to work
 through the tax code.

Title:  Understanding the Flattening Phillips Curve
Abstract:  Policy-makers have recently noted an apparent flattening of the Phillips curve.
 The implications of such a change include that a positive output gap would be less
 inflationary, but the cost of reducing inflation, once established, would increase.
 This paperÂ’s objective is to review the evidence and possible explanations for the
 flattening of the Phillips curve in the context of new-Keynesian economic theory.
 Using data for the United States and Australia, we find that the flattening is evident
 in the baseline Â‘structural?new-Keynesian Phillips curve. We consider a variety
 of reasons for this structural flattening, such as data problems, globalisation and
 alternative definitions of marginal cost, none of which is entirely satisfactory.

Title: The Effect of Marital Status and Children on Savings and Portfolio Choice
Abstract:  This paper investigates the impact of demographic shocks on optimal decisions about
 saving, life insurance, and, most centrally, asset allocation. We analyze these choices
 within the framework of a life-cycle model that features exogenous changes in family
 composition, heterogeneity in lifetime income, and uninsurable fluctuations in earnings and medical
 costs. Our analysis indicates that marital-status transitions and children
 can have important effects on optimal household decisions. Widowhood induces sharp
 reductions in the portfolio shares in stock, and the impact is largest for women and
 individuals with children. Divorce causes men and women to reallocate their portfolios
 in different directions; men choose much riskier allocations, while women opt for safer
 ones. Children play a fundamental role in the optimal portfolio decisions. Men with
 children, for example, increase their shares in response to divorce by less than half
 as much as men without children. Comparing our simulation results with panel-data
 evidence on stockholding from the PSID and the HRS, we conclude that changes in
 marital status and children matter empirically as well, but not always in the ways that
 the model predicts.

Title: A New Look at the Wealth Adequacy of Older U.S. Households
Abstract:  We examine the current wealth adequacy of older U.S. households using the 1998-2006 waves
 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We find that the median older U.S. household is
 reasonably well situated, with a ratio of comprehensive net wealth to present value poverty-
 line wealth of about 3.9 in 2006. About 18 percent of households, however, have less wealth
 than would be needed to generate 150 percent of poverty-line income over their expected future
 lifetimes. We see similar patterns of wealth adequacy when we examine ratios of annualized
 comprehensive wealth to pre-retirement earnings. Comparing the leading edge of the baby
 boomers in 2006 to households of the same age in 1998, we find that the baby boomers show
 slightly less wealth, in real terms, than their elders did, but still have appear to have adequate
 resources at the median. Moreover, we find a rising age profile of annualized wealth, even within
 households over time and after controlling for other factors, suggesting that older households
 are not spending their wealth as quickly as their survival probabilities are falling.

Title: Does Health Affect Portfolio Choice?
Abstract:  Previous studies find a strong and positive empirical connection between health status
 and the share of risky assets held in household portfolios. But is this relationship
 truly causal, in the sense that households respond to changes in health by altering their
 portfolio allocation, or does it simply reflect unobserved differences across households?
 We find that the link between health and risky assets depends crucially on the econometric treatment of unobserved
 heterogeneity. Once we account adequately for unobserved household differences, we find no statistically significant
 effect of health status on either portfolio allocations or ownership among older households (those with respondents 70
 and older) in the Health and Retirement Study. Younger households, in contrast, do
 seem to adjust their portfolios on both the extensive and intensive margins in response
 to health shocks.

Title: The Trajectory of Wealth in Retirement
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a measure of household resources that converts total
 financial, nonfinancial, and annuitized assets into an expected annual amount of wealth
 per person in retirement. We use this measure, which we call "annualized comprehensive
 wealth," to investigate spend-down behavior among a panel of older households in the
 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1998 to 2006. Our analysis indicates that for
 most retired households, comprehensive wealth balances decline much more slowly than
 their remaining life expectancies, so that the predominate trend is for real annualized
 wealth actually to rise significantly with age over the course of retirement. Comparing
 the estimated age profiles for annualized wealth with profiles simulated from several
 different life cycle models, we find that a model that takes into account uncertain
 longevity, random medical expenses, and intended bequests lines up best with the broad
 patterns of rising annualized wealth in the HRS.

Title: The 2007 Meltdown in Structured Securitization: Searching for Lessons not Scapegoats
Abstract:   The intensity of recent turbulence in financial markets has surprised nearly
 everyone. This paper searches out the root causes of the crisis, distinguishing them from
 scapegoating explanations that have been used in policy circles to divert attention from
 the underlying breakdown of incentives. Incentive conflicts explain how securitization
 went wrong, why credit ratings proved so inaccurate, and why it is superficial to blame
 the crisis on mark-to-market accounting, an unexpected loss of liquidity or trends in
 globalization and deregulation in financial markets. Our analysis finds disturbing
 implications of the crisis for Basel II and its implementation. We argue that the principal
 source of financial instability lies in contradictory political and bureaucratic incentives
 that undermine the effectiveness of financial regulation and supervision in every country
 in the world. We conclude the paper by identifying reforms that would improve

Title: Banking Crises
Abstract:   The history of banking around the world has been punctuated by frequent systemic crises.
 As with Tolstoy's unhappy families, not all crises are the same; distinct roles have been
 played at different times by mismanagement, government interference and
 macroeconomic shocks. This review identifies common features of crises in recent
 decades and describes how costly they have been in terms of their fiscal burden and the
 impact on macroeconomic growth. It proceeds to outline the conceptual issues identified
 by theoreticians and considers appropriate policy responses. A lull in the new millennium
 led to optimism that banking crises might be a thing of the past, but the events of 2007-8
 have shown such optimism, often characteristic of previous macro upswings, to be
 unwarranted.

Title: Does Marriage Really Mattter? Investments in Prenatal Care and Birth Outcomes
Abstract:  Nonmarital childbearing has increased dramatically in the United States in recent decades. A great deal of
 attention has been paid by both academics and policy makers to this increase, in part because of concerns that having
 a single mother negatively affects child outcomes. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B)
 to investigate whether marriage is associated with greater investments in prenatal care and better birth outcomes, and the
 extent to which this Â“marriage effect?is heterogeneous. Our results suggest that marriage is significantly and positively
 correlated with investments in prenatal care and birth outcomes. However, we find a great deal of heterogeneity in these
 relationships. Unmarried motherhood among educated mothers (those with a college degree or higher) is not associated with
 lower levels of investment in prenatal care nor with negative birth outcomes. There is also heterogeneity across racial and
 ethnic groups in the marital status effect that differs by which outcome is being examined. We also find that including
 observable characteristics and addressing unobserved characteristics reduces but does not eliminate the positive correlation
 between marital status and prenatal care investments, but that these remaining differentials in investments do not appear to
 translate into significant differences in infant health outcomes. This variation in marital status effects suggests that the
 benefits of marriage may be overstated, and that policy efforts to improve childrenÂ’s well-being through promoting marriage
 might be reexamined to take this into account.

Title: Utilization of Infertility Treatments: The Effects of Insurance Mandates
Abstract: Over the last several decades, both delay of childbearing and fertility problems have become increasingly
 common among women in developed countries. At the same time, technological changes have made many more options available
 to individuals experiencing fertility problems. However, these technologies are expensive, and only 25% of health care plans
 in the United States cover infertility treatment. As a result of these high costs, legislation has been passed in 15 states that
 mandates insurance coverage of infertility treatment in private insurance plans. In this paper, we examine whether mandated
 insurance coverage for infertility treatment affects utilization for a specific subgroup in the population: older, highly educated women.
 These women are both at high risk for fertility problems, and have high rates of coverage by insurance plans affected by the mandates.
 We find robust evidence that while an effect of the mandates on utilization can not be found for the full population of women, the
 mandates do have a large and significant effect on utilization for exactly this subgroup.

Title: Cosigners as Collateral
Abstract: We investigate the role of cosigners as collateral using data from a South Indian financial institution.
 Using an exogenous change in the cosigner requirement, we establish a negative causal effect of cosigners on defaults:
 an increase in the number of cosigners reduces defaults all these equal. Our results suggest that a one-sixth increase in the
 number of cosigners reduces the incidence of a default by 7.5 percent. While most theories of collateral predict that increased
 cosigners will reduce defaults, we are first to find empirical evidence of this effect.

Title: Borrower Runs
Abstract: Microfinance institutions and other lenders in developing countries rely on
 the promise of future loans to induce repayment. However, if borrowers expect
 that others will default, and so loans will no longer be available in the future,
 then they will default as well. We refer to such contagion as a borrower run.
 The optimal lending contract must provide additional repayment incentives to
 counter this tendency to default.

Title: Extreme Returns without News: A Microstructural Explanation
Abstract:  What triggers extreme exchange-rate returns? Though news is the source of volatility in
 standard theoretical models, in reality volatility is often unrelated to news. This paper shows that
 extreme exchange-rate returns -- and, more generally, high kurtosis of returns -- are statistically
 inevitable even in the absence of news. We identify four microstructural sources of return
 kurtosis in price-contingent order flow: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of price-contingent
 order sizes; (2) clustering of price-contingent order executions at certain times of day; (3)
 clustering of order executions at certain price levels; and (4) the tendency of positive-feedback
 trading to propagate trends. Using simulations calibrated to price-contingent orders placed at a
 major foreign exchange dealing bank we show that when each factor operates in isolation, the
 one that contributes most to kurtosis in returns is kurtosis in the order-size distribution. When the
 factors operate simultaneously, however, their interactions prove far more important. Extreme
 returns in the absence of news should be viewed as natural rather than anomalous.

Title: How Does Charitable Giving Respond to Incentives and Income? New Estimates from Panel Data
Abstract:  We estimate the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to persistent and transitory price and income changes using a 1979-2006
 panel of tax returns. Our estimation procedure allows for anticipation of and gradual adjustment to tax changes, controls for various potential
 sources of omitted variable bias via fixed effects and income-class specific year dummies, and allows for a flexible non-linear relationship between income and charitable giving. Our most convincing estimates are identified by differences in the time-paths of tax incentives across states, and suggest a persistent price elasticity in excess of one in absolute value.

Title: Only Twice As Much: A Rule for Regulating Lenders
Abstract: Present-day policies aiming to improve the performance of credit markets,
 such as group-lending or creation of collateral, typically aim to change incentives
 for borrowers. In contrast, pre-modern credit market interventions, such as
 usury laws, often targeted the behavior of lenders. We describe and model a norm
 which, though widespread, has escaped scholarly attention: a stipulation that accumulated
 interest cannot exceed the original principal, irrespective of how much
 time has elapsed. We interpret this rule, which is found in Hindu, Roman, and
 Chinese legal traditions, as giving lenders the incentive to find more capable borrowers,
 who will be able to repay early, thereby improving the allocation of capital.
 We document the consistency between our explanation and the rationale offered by
 policy-makers.

Title: Do Markets Care Who Chairs the Central Bank?
Abstract: This paper assesses the effects of central bank governor appointments on financial market expectations of
 monetary policy. To measure these effects, we assemble a new dataset of appointment announcements from 15 countries, and
 conduct an event study analysis on exchange rates, bond yields, and stock prices. The analysis reveals a significant
 reaction of exchange rates and bond yields to unexpected appointments. The reactions are not unidirectional, and thus do
 not suggest new governors suffer from a generic credibility problem. Federal Reserve chairman appointments stand out in
 terms of their unusually pronounced effects on financial markets.

Title: Why Do Firms Offer Risky Defined Benefit Pension Plans?
Abstract: Even risky pension sponsors could offer essentially riskless pension promises by contributing a
 sufficient level of resources to their pension trust funds and by investing those resources in fixed-income
 securities designed to deliver their payoffs just as pension obligations are coming due. However, almost no firm
 has chosen to fund its plan in this manner. We study the optimal funding choice for plan sponsors by developing a
 simple model of pension financing in which the total compensation offered to workers must clear the labor market.
 We find that if workers understand the implications of pension risk, they will demand greater compensation for
 riskier pension promises than for safer ones, all else equal. Indeed, in our model, pension sponsors maximize
 their value by making their pension promises free of risk. We close by positing some explanations for why no
 real-world firm follows the prescription of our model.

Title: Risk Preferences and the Timing of Marriage and Childbearing
Abstract: The existing literature on marriage and fertility decisions pays little attention to the roles
 played by risk preferences and uncertainty. However, given uncertainty regarding the arrival of suitable marriage
 partners, the ability to contracept, and the ability to conceive, womenÂ’s risk preferences might be expected to
 play an important role in marriage and fertility timing decisions. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,
 I find that measured risk preferences have a significant effect on both marriage and fertility timing. Highly risk
 tolerant women are more likely to delay marriage, consistent with either a search model of marriage or a risk-pooling
 explanation. In addition, risk preferences affect fertility timing in a way that differs by marital status and education,
 and that varies over the lifecycle. Greater tolerance for risk leads to earlier births at young ages, consistent with
 these women being less likely to contracept effectively. In addition, as the subgroup of college-educated, unmarried
 women nears the end of their fertile periods, highly risk tolerant women are likely to delay childbearing relative to
 their more risk averse counterparts, and are therefore less likely to become mothers. These findings may have broader
 implications for both individual and societal well-being.

Title: Exchange Rate Response to Macro News: Through the Lens of Microstructure
Abstract: This study investigates the micro effects of macro news using customer price-contingent orders
 (i.e. stop-loss and take-profit orders) data from a large foreign exchange dealing bank in the
 pound/dollar market. Results reveal that price-contingent order placement intensifies 3 to 5 hours
 prior to the news events. I examine the link between this surge in order placement and the
 exchange-rate jump following the announcement. I find that price-contingent orders can enhance
 our ability to explain post-release exchange-rate returns by half. Furthermore, the estimated
 effect of orders is orthogonal to the news surprises. This implies that there may be a component
 of the news response that purely reflects institutional features such as order types and not
 necessarily the public information itself.

Title: Adverse Selection in Credit Markets: Evidence from a Policy Experiment
Abstract: We test if riskier borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates than safer borrowers
 are as predicted by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981). The data are from an Indian financial institution where interest
 rates are determined by competitive bidding. The government imposed an interest rate ceiling in 1993 and then
 relaxed the ceiling in 2002. Changes in default patters are analyzed before and after each of these policy changes.
 We find no evidence of adverse selection despite the use of collateral as a screening device. This study isolates
 adverse selection from moral hazard and controls for information on riskiness observed by the lender but not by the researcher.

Title:  Gender, Marriage, and Asset Accumulation in the United States
Abstract: Wealth accumulation has important implications for the relative well-being of
 households. This article describes how household wealth in the United States
 varies by gender and family type. Evidence is found of large differences in
 observed wealth between single-female-headed households and married
 couples. Although some of this gap reflects differences in observable characteristics
 correlated with gender and wealth Â– such as position in the life cycle,
 education, and family earnings Â– controlling for these characteristics reduces but
 does not eliminate the estimated wealth gap. The wealth holdings of single
 females in the US, controlling for these same characteristics, are also significantly
 lower than the wealth holdings of single males. In contrast, observed wealth gaps
 between genders in a sub-sample of young households disappear when
 controlling for observable characteristics, suggesting either that in the US these
 gaps are disappearing for younger households or that these gaps do not emerge
 until later in life.

Abstract: Trade and export, it is argued, spur economic growth. This paper studies the microeconomics
 of exporting. We build a heuristic model of transactions between exporters and
 producers and relate it to East India Company operations in colonial Bengal. Our model and
 the historical record stress two difficulties: the exporter and its agents might not uphold pricing
 agreements, and producers might not honor sales contracts. The model shows when procurement
 succeeds or fails, highlighting the tension between these two hold-up problems. We analyze several
 cases including the East India Company's textile venture, the famous Opium Monopoly, and
 present-day contract farming.

Abstract: Previous studies have found that the returns to education in rural China are far lower than
 estimates for other developing economies. In this paper, we seek to determine why previous estimates are so
 low and provide estimates of what we believe are more accurate measures of the returns. Whereas estimates for
 the early 1990s average 2.3 percent, we find an average return of 6.4 percent. Furthermore, we find even higher
 returns among younger people, migrants,and for post-primary education. The paper demonstrates that, although
 part of the difference between our estimate and previous estimates can be attributed to increasing returns
 during the 1990s, a larger part of the difference is due to the nature of the data and the methodological
 approaches used by other authors.

Title: Timing vs. Long-run Charitable Giving Behavior: Reconciling Divergent Approaches and Estimates
Abstract: In this paper we examine the effect of the income tax on charitable giving. An important
 challenge in this literature has been to estimate the long-run response of giving to a
 persistent change in tax-price, which can be difficult to distinguish from intertemporal
 substitution arising from differences between current and expected future tax prices,
 arising for example due to transitory fluctuations in incomes, life-cycle factors, or preannounced
 tax reforms. Several papers that have attempted to distinguish these effects
 have found that the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to a persistent price change
 is small, while the elasticity with respect to a transitory difference between current and
 expected future prices is large. Auten, Sieg, and Clotfelter (2002) advance this literature
 by developing an estimation procedure that incorporates a more sophisticated model of
 the stochastic process for income. In contrast to previous research on the topic, they find
 the counterintuitive result that the immediate response to a persistent price change is
 much larger than the immediate response to a one-period transitory price change. In this
 paper, we present a new estimation procedure that allows us to implement their
 assumptions about the stochastic process of income in a more conventional regression
 framework, and then adapt the procedure to take into account the pre-announced and
 phased-in nature of tax reforms that occurred during the sample period. In preliminary
 analysis based on a public-use panel of individual tax return data, we are able to replicate
 their counterintuitive pattern of price elasticities, and find that incorporating information
 about pre-announced and phased-in tax law changes reverses their result Â– the persistent
 price elasticity is reduced substantially, and the transitory price elasticity is now the
 larger of the two. We also try an instrumental variables strategy that relies exclusively on
 federal and state tax reforms for identification, and this yields similar results. Finally, we
 incorporate a dynamic adjustment process into the empirical specification, and find
 evidence that the long-run response to persistent price and income changes is larger than
 the immediate response.

Note:
Abstract: Infertility currently affects over 6 million individuals in the United States. While most health
 insurance plans nationwide do not cover infertility diagnoses or treatments, to date fifteen states
 have enacted some form of infertility insurance mandate. In this paper, I use data from the Vital
 Statistics Detail Natality Data and Census population estimates to examine whether these statelevel
 mandates were successful in increasing fertility rates. Using a difference-in-differences
 approach, I exploit variation in the enactment of mandates both across states and over time, and
 identify control groups that should not have been affected by infertility coverage. My results
 suggest that the mandates significantly increase first birth rates for women over 35, and these
 results are robust to a number of specification tests.

 expansions for low-income children. In this paper, I reexamine the expansions' impact on Medicaid
 take-up and private insurance "crowd-out." Focusing on the most influential estimates of the
 expansions' impact, I show that while many of the critiques leveled at these estimates have little
 effect on their magnitude, accounting for age-specific trends in coverage produces estimates similar
 to others in the literature. Estimating the impact of later expansions using additional years of data,
 I find low rates of take-up and no evidence of crowding out.

 is identified using exogenous variation across counties in the timing of national identity card
 distribution, which make it easier for rural migrants to register as temporary residents in urban
 destinations. We make use of a large panel household and village data set supplemented by an
 original follow-up survey, and find a robust negative relationship between migrant opportunity
 and high school enrollment. This effect is consistent with our finding of low returns to high
 school education among migrants from surveyed villages.

Abstract: Numerous policy studies have argued that conditions have prevailed in China since the
 open door economic reforms of the late 1970s that have encouraged rapid growth at the expense
 of regional income inequality across the provinces of China. In this paper we use recently
 developed nonstationary panel techniques to provide empirical support for the fact that the long
 run tendency since the reforms has been for provincial level incomes to continue to diverge. More
 importantly, we show that this divergence cannot be attributed to the presence of separate,
 regional convergence clubs divided among common geographic subgroupings such as the coastal
 versus interior provinces. Furthermore, we also show that the divergence cannot be attributed to
 differences in the degree of preferential open-door policies. Rather, we find that the divergence is
 pervasive both nationally and within these various regional and political subgroupings. We argue
 that these results point to other causes for regional income divergence, and they also carry
 potentially important implications for other regions of the world.

Abstract: To what extent do differential levels of investment in public health inputs
 explain observed differences in health outcomes across socioeconomic and racial groups?
 This study investigates the impact of 3,700 projects that were part of a widespread
 Federal initiative to improve sanitation infrastructure on U.S. Indian reservations starting
 in 1960. Sanitation investment substantially reduced the cost of clean water for
 households, leading to sharp reductions in both waterborne gastrointestinal disease and
 infectious respiratory disease among Native American infants. The sanitation program
 was quite cost-effective, in part because improvements in the overall disease environment
 also reduced infectious respiratory disease among nearby white infants. Despite the
 health externalities, Federal sanitation interventions explain almost forty percent of the
 convergence in Native American and white infant mortality rates in reservation counties
 since 1970.

Abstract: Dramatic increases in the capabilities and decreases in the costs of
 computers and communication networks have fomented revolutionary
 thoughts in the scholarly publishing community. In one dimension,
 traditional pricing schemes and product packages are being modified

 in pricing and bundling for electronic access to scholarly journals:
 PEAK. We provided Internet-based delivery of content from
 1200 Elsevier Science journals to users at multiple campuses and commercial
 facilities. Our primary research objective was to generate rich
 empirical evidence on user behavior when faced with various bundling
 schemes and price structures. In this article we explain the different
 types and levels of cost that users faced when accessing individual articles,
 and report on the effect of these costs on usage. We found that
 both monetary and non-monetary user costs have a significant impact
 on the demand for electronic access. We also estimate how taking user
 costs into account would change the optimal (least cost) bundle of
 access options that an institution should purchase.

Title: Capitalising the Value of Free Schools: The Impact of Supply Characteristics and Uncertainty
Author-Name: Paul Cheshire

Author-Workplace-Name: Williams College
Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://econ.williams.edu
Abstract: There has been a growing literature in both the US (for example Haurin and Brasington 1996, and Black 1999)
 and the UK (for example Gibbons & Machin, 2003) that estimates the way in which school quality is capitalised into
 house prices. Cheshire and Sheppard 1995 and 1999 estimated hedonic models in which the quality of the secondary
 school to which a household was assigned was a significant variable which provided evidence that secondary school
 quality was being capitalised into the price of houses. In contrast Gibbons and Machin concluded that primary schools
 were more significant. Each of these analyses is predicated on the assumption that the value of local schools should
 be reflected in the value of houses.  We argue here that this is rather too simple. We should expect variation in the
 capitalised price of a given school quality at either primary or secondary level according to the elasticity of
 supply of 'school quality' in the local market, the certainty with which that quality can be expected to be maintained
 over time and the suitability of the dwelling to accommodate children. These factors will vary systematically between
 and perhaps within cities. This paper explores the sources and the impact of such variations as well as the impact of
 model specification. The results provide new evidence on the complex and subtle ways in which housing markets
 capitalise the value of local public goods such as school quality and perhaps most importantly suggest that this
 is highly non-linear:  houses in the catchment areas of only the best state schools command substantial premiums
 but such capitalised values can be very substantial indeed.

Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical and empirical investigation of conservation behavior that
 is motivated by concern for the environment. Two types of behavior are considered. First,
 individuals who care about environmental quality may voluntarily restrain their consumption
 of goods and services that generate a negative externality. Second, individuals may choose
 to pay a voluntary price premium for goods and services that are more "environmentally
 friendly." A theoretical model highlights the relationship between such voluntary restraint
 and a voluntary price premium. We test predictions of the model in an empirical study of
 household electricity consumption with introduction of a price-premium, green-electricity
 program. We find evidence of voluntary restraint and its relation to a voluntary price
 premium. The empirical results are consistent with the model of conservation behavior,
 as none of the theoretical predictions can be rejected.

Abstract: In rural areas of many developing countries, including China, people do not have the chance to
 retire, but rather have to continue working as they age.  In this paper, we have two specific objectives.
 First, we will illustrate the work and retirement patterns of the elderly, and develop a profile of the
 characteristics of the elderly that work and those that do not.  We will describe the work contours both
 in the formal and informal sectors.  Second, we will examine the determinants of work and retirement and
 attempt to surmise from these the strategies that the elderly use to support themselves when they are old.
 One finding of interest is that we find evidence of behavior among the elderly that in many cases they are
 willing to sacrifice their own current consumption and asset accumulation to help make their children more
 productive so the children will be able to better care for their parents when they are older.

Abstract: Children of educated mothers fare better on a variety of educational outcomes.
 However, little research has been done on the effects of human capital investments
 undertaken by mothers with children at home. Such investments have a theoretically
 ambiguous effect on child outcomes, since human capital investment reduces time spent
 with children but may have positive spillover effects on child investment. Using childand
 sibling-fixed effects models to deal with unobserved heterogeneity, we find that
 cumulative maternal schooling undertaken during a child's lifetime has significant
 positive effects on child outcomes, and that negative time allocation effects are minimal.

Abstract: This paper examines how changes in state tax policy affect the number of federal estate
 tax returns filed in each state, utilizing data on federal estate tax return filings by state
 and wealth class for 18 years between 1965 and 1998. Controlling for state- and wealthclass
 specific fixed effects, we find that high state inheritance and estate taxes and sales
 taxes have statistically significant, but modest, negative impacts on the number of federal
 estate tax returns filed in a state. High personal income tax and property tax burdens are
 also found to have negative effects, but these results are somewhat sensitive to alternative
 specifications. This evidence is consistent with the notion that wealthy elderly people
 change their real (or reported) state of residence to avoid high state taxes, although it
 could partly reflect other modes of tax avoidance as well. We discuss the implications for
 the debate over whether individual states should decouple their estate taxes from
 federal law, which would retain the state tax even as the federal credit for such taxes is
 eliminated. Our results suggest that migration and other observationally equivalent
 avoidance activities in response to such a tax would cause revenue losses and deadweight
 losses, but that these would not be large relative to the revenue raised by the tax.

Abstract: During the last four years, the eight Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 have
 made significant strides toward financial integration with the EU. Several pieces of evidence support
 this finding. First, yields on long-term sovereign bonds in accession countries have converged towards
 EU levels. This is true for both bonds denominated in local currency and bonds denominated in euro.
 Second, while the issuance of euro-denominated corporate bonds from accession countries is limited,
 yields on existing corporate bonds are in line with those in the old EU countries. Third, margins
 in the banking sector have narrowed, which is consistent with the integration of banking markets.
 Finally, we note that the current stock market rally is consistent with equity market integration.

Abstract: We analyze lending contracts when social sanctions are used to enforce repayments
 and borrowers differ in their unobserved sanctioning abilities. Symmetric group loans
 are preferred to cosigned loans when borrowers are relatively equal, and cosigned
 loans are preferred when borrowers are unequal. This explains why microlenders
 that target the poor (e.g., the Grameen Bank) use symmetric group loans while other
 untargeted lenders use cosigned loans. Complicated menus of loan contracts that
 induce borrowers to self select can do no better than these simple loan contracts
 unless borrowers are very productive. In particular, we explain why group lending
 arrangements offering different loan terms to members of the same group are seldom
 observed.

Abstract: We use VARs to study the transmission of shocks in Argentina during the currency board
 regime. We focus on shocks to international commodity prices, U.S. monetary policy, the
 real effective exchange rate, and the sovereign risk premium on emerging market debt. Of
 those factors, only the sovereign risk premium affects output significantly, which we believe
 is really a proxy for beliefs about fiscal solvency. Both the monetary base and money market
 interest rates react to U.S. monetary policy, but such shocks do not affect Argentine output

Abstract: Green-electricity programs provide an opportunity to study private provision of public goods in a field setting.
 The first part of this paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze household decisions about voluntary participation
 in green-electricity programs. We consider different participation mechanisms and show how they relate to existing theory on
 either pure or impure public goods. The models are used to examine the implications of
 participation mechanisms for the level of public-good provision. The second part of the
 paper provides an empirical investigation of actual participation decisions in two green-
 electricity programs: one based on a pure public good and the other based on an impure
 public good. The data come from original household surveys of participants and nonparticipants in
 both programs, along with utility data on household electricity consumption.
 The econometric results are interpreted in the context of the theoretical models and are
 compared to other studies of privately provided public goods.

Abstract: This paper provides an empirical investigation of the factors that in?uence the appearance
 and success of voter referenda for policies designed to promote open-space conservation.
 We take advantage of a data set that includes detailed information on all such referenda
 that occurred in the United States between 1998 and 2003. Combining these data with
 information from the U.S. Census, we conduct a nationwide analysis along with focused
 analyses of referenda that occurred in New Jersey and Massachusetts. Among the questions
 that we consider are the following: What factors contribute to the appearance of an open-
 space referendum in a jurisdiction? How does an initiative's funding mechanism, such as a
 bond, property tax, sales tax, or income tax, affect the way citizens vote? How responsive
 are favorable votes to the costs of an open-space initiative? And how do socioeconomic
characteristics affect demand for public provision of open space?

Abstract: We use agent-based models to consider rent ceilings in non-Walrasian housing markets, where bargaining
 between landlord and tenant leads to exchange at a range of prices. In the non-Walrasian setting agents
 who would be extramarginal in the Walrasian setting frequently are successful in renting, and actually
 account for a significant share of the units rented. This has several implications. First, rent ceilings above
 the Walrasian equilibrium price (WEP) can affect the market outcome. Second, rent ceilings that reduce
 the number of units rented do not necessarily reduce total market surplus. Finally, the distributional
 impact of rent controls differs from the Walrasian setting.

Abstract: We investigate the long run consequences of infrastructure provision on per capita income in a
 panel of countries over the period 1950-1992. Simple panel based tests are developed which enable us to
 isolate the sign and direction of the long run effect of infrastructure on income in a manner that is robust
 to the presence of unknown heterogeneous short run causal relationships. Our results provide clear
 evidence that in the vast majority of cases infrastructure does induce long run growth effects. But we also
 find a great deal of variation in the results across individual countries. Taken as a whole, the results
 demonstrate that telephones, electricity generating capacity and paved roads are provided at close to the
 growth maximizing level on average, but are under-supplied in some countries and over-supplied in
 others. These results also help to explain why cross section and time series studies have in the past found
 contradictory results regarding a causal link between infrastructure provision and long run growth.

Title: Social Capital, Barriers to Production, and Capital Shares: Implications for the
  Importance of Parameter Heterogeneity from a Nonstationary Panel Approach
Author-Name: Peter Pedroni

Note:
Abstract: Recent advances in the growth literature have proposed that difficult to quantify concepts such as social
 capital may play an important role in explaining the degree of persistent income disparity that is observed among
 countries. Other recently explored possibilities include institutional mechanisms which generate barriers to aggregate
 production. An important limitation for empirical work in this area stems from the fact that it is difficult to distinguish
 sources of heterogeneity when direct observations are not available. In this study, we show how developments in the
 analysis of nonstationary dynamic panels can aid in this endeavor. In contrast to traditional panel data analysis, this
 approach focuses explicitly on low frequency behavior. Under relatively mild assumptions, the approach can be used to
 infer properties of aggregate production which are robust to the presence of large classes of unobserved features. In this
 framework we are able to estimate and test the implied distribution of production function parameters that would be
 required in order to generate conditional forecast convergence of per capita incomes even when some of the key factors
 required to explain growth are unobserved. The results indicate that in order to fully explain the observed persistence in
 the disparity of per capita incomes, the manner in which unobserved mechanisms influence production must go beyond
 merely accounting for differences in the trending behavior of aggregate productivity. Specifically, the results
 demonstrate that if such mechanisms are to be successful empirically, then they must also be able to account for cross
 country heterogeneity in steady state capital shares. This adds to a growing literature that provides support for models
 with multiple production regimes.

Abstract: This study clarifies the conditions under which learning in games produces convergence to Nash equilibria
 in practice. Previous work has identified theoretical conditions under which various stylized learning
 processes achieve convergence. One technical condition is supermodularity, which is closely related to
 the more familiar concept of strategic complementarities. We experimentally investigate the role of supermodularity
 in achieving convergence through learning. Using a game from the literature on solutions to
 externalities, we systematically vary a free parameter below, close to, at and beyond the threshold of supermodularity
 to assess its effects on convergence. We find that supermodular and Â¡Â°near-supermodularÂ¡Â± games
 converge significantly better than those far below the threshold. From a little below the threshold to the
 threshold, the improvement is statistically insignificant. Within the class of supermodular games, increasing
 the parameter far beyond the threshold does not significantly improve convergence. Simulation shows that
 while most experimental results persist in the long run, some become more pronounced.

Abstract: Digital information economies require information goods producers
 to learn how to position themselves within a potentially vast product
 space. Further, the topography of this space is often nonstationary,
 due to the interactive dynamics of multiple producers changing
 their position as they try to learn the distribution of consumer preferences
 and other features of the problem's economic structure. This
 presents a producer or its agent with a difficult learning problem:
 how to locate profitable niches in a very large space.
 In this paper, we present a model of an information goods duopoly
 and show that, under complete information, producers would prefer
 not to compete, instead acting as local monopolists and targeting
 separate niches in the consumer population. However, when producers
 have no information about the problem they are solving, it
 can be quite difficult for them to converge on this solution. We show
 how a modest amount of economic knowledge about the problem
 can make it much easier, either by reducing the search space, starting
 in a useful area of the space, or introducing a gradient. These experiments
 support the hypothesis that a producer using some knowledge
 of a problem's (economic) structure can outperform a producer
 that is performing a naive, knowledge-free form of learning.

Title: Charitable Bequests and Taxes on Inheritance and Estates: Aggregate Evidence from Across States and Time
Abstract: One recurring issue in the debate over the estate tax is its impact on the non-profit sector.
 With the top marginal rate of federal estate tax currently at 49 percent, abolishing the tax would approximately
 double the price of a charitable bequest relative to an ordinary bequest for the wealthiest estates. It would also,
 however, raise the after-tax wealth of decedents, so the ultimate impact of any particular policy change depends
 in part on the relative sizes of the price and wealth elasticities. This paper estimates the impact of taxes on
 charitable bequests using an econometric framework that exploits the fact that federal and state tax rates on estates
 and inheritances have changed over time in different ways across states and real wealth levels. The effect of federal
 and state inheritance and estate taxes on charitable bequests is estimated using pooled cross-sectional data spanning
 several decades information from federal estate tax returns. Under several different specifications, we find evidence
 that the incentives for charitable giving present in state and federal estate and inheritance taxes have a strong positive
 effect on charitable bequests. Our estimates that rely on differences in the time path of state and federal tax rates across
 groups provide a more credible source of identification than the previous literature of a large and significant price
 elasticity of charitable bequests.

Title: Mega-Sporting Events in Developing Nations : Playing the Way to Prosperity?
Abstract: Supporters of mega-sporting events such as the World Cup and Olympics claim that these
 events attract hoards of wealthy visitors and lead to lasting economic benefits for the host regions. For
 this reason, cities and countries compete vigorously for the right to stage these spectacles. Recently,
 developing countries have become increasingly vocal in demanding that they get the right to share in the
 economic benefits of these international games. China, for example, has been awarded the 2008
 Summer Olympics, and an African nation seems destined to host the 2010 World Cup. The specialized
 infrastructure and operating expenses required to host these events, however, can be extremely costly,
 and it is not at all clear that either the long or short-term benefits of the games are anywhere nearly large
 enough to cover these costs.
 	This paper reviews other researchersÂ’ as well as our own previous work on mega-sporting
 events such as the Super Bowl and World Series as well as international events like the World Cup and
 Olympics. Independent researchers nearly unanimously find that boostersÂ’ projections of the economic
 impact of sporting events exaggerate the true economic impact of these competitions by a wide margin.
 In particular, in this paper we focus on the particular circumstances that face developing countries
 hosting these games. Our research suggests that in most cases mega-sporting events are an even worse
 investment for developing countries than for industrialized countries.

Title: In Search of a Fair Bet in the Lottery
Abstract:  Although state-operated lotto games have the worst average expected payoffs
 among common games of chance, because the jackpot can accumulate, the maximum expected
 payoff is potentially unlimited. It is possible, therefore, that lotto can exhibit a positive expected
 return.
 	This paper examines 18,000 drawings in 34 American lotteries and finds approximately
 1% of these drawings provided players with a fair bet. Furthermore, if it were possible for a
 bettor to purchase every possible combination, most lotteries commonly experience
 circumstances where such a purchase would provide a positive return with 11% of the drawings
 providing a fair bet to the player.

Title: Super Bowl or Super (Hyper)Bole? Assessing the Economic Impact of America's Premier Sports Event
Abstract:  Civic boosters generally have estimated the Super Bowl to have an impact of $300 to
 $400 million on a host cityÂ’s economy. The National Football League (NFL) has used the
 promise of an economic windfall to convince skeptical cities that investments in new stadiums
 for their teams in exchange for the right to host the event makes economic sense. In fact the
 recent average public contribution for a new or renovated NFL stadium, $209 million, is less
 than the size of the economic impact estimates. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate
 booster claims. Statistical analysis reveals that, on average, the Super Bowl could not have
 contributed by any reasonable standard of statistical significance, more than $300 million to host
 economies. Indeed, the evidence indicates that at best the Super Bowl contributes approximately
 one-quarter of what the NFL promises.

Title: The Â“Death-EffectÂ” on Collectible Prices
Abstract: It has been widely observed that the price of celebrity memorabilia rises around the time of that
 personÂ’s death. Previous authors attribute this Â“death-effectÂ” primarily to expectations on the part of
 collectors concerning the future supply of collectibles about the public figure as in the case of a durable
 goods monopolist. Our observations of the sports memorabilia market suggest that the increase in
 prices is instead due to a Â“nostalgia effectÂ” as a result of the media attention that surrounds the death of
 a prominent public figure.

Title: The Measurement of Medicaid Coverage in the SIPP : Evidence from a Comparison of
  Matched Records
Abstract: This paper studies the accuracy of reported Medicaid coverage in the Survey of Income
 and Program Participation (SIPP) using a unique data set formed by matching SIPP survey
 responses to administrative records from the State of California. Overall, we estimate that the
 SIPP underestimates Medicaid coverage in the California population by about 10 percent. The
 probability that a SIPP respondent who is covered by Medicaid in a given month correctly
 reports their coverage is around 85 percent. The corresponding probability for low-income
 children is higher Â– around 90 percent. Under-reporting by those who are actually in the
 Medicaid system is partially offset by over-reporting of coverage by people who are not. Some
 of these false positive responses are attributable to errors and missing data in the administrative
 system, rather than to problems in the SIPP. Taking account of these errors, the estimated false
 positive rate for the population as a whole is about 1.5 percent, and 4-5 percent for poor children.

Title: The Effect of Medicaid Expansions for Low-Income Children
 on Medicaid Participation and Private Insurance Coverage : Evidence from the SIPP
Abstract:  We examine Medicaid enrollment and private coverage loss following expansions of Medicaid
 eligibility. We attempt to replicate Cutler and GruberÂ’s (1996) results using the Survey of Income
 and Program Participation, and find smaller rates of take-up and little evidence of crowding out. We
 find that some of the difference in results can be attributed to different samples and recall periods in
 the data sets used. Extending the previous literature, we find that take-up is slightly increased if a
 childÂ’s siblings are eligible and with time spent eligible. Focusing on children whose eligibility
 status changes during the sample, we estimate smaller take-up effects. We find little evidence of
 crowding out in any of our extensions.

Title: Using Discontinuous Eligibility Rules to Identify the Effects
 of the Federal Medicaid Expansions on Low Income Children
Abstract:  Despite intensive scrutiny, the effects of Medicaid expansions on the health insurance status of
 low-income children remain controversial. We re-examine the effects of the two largest
 federally-mandated expansions which offered Medicaid coverage to low-income children in
 specific age ranges and birth cohorts. We use a regression discontinuity approach, comparing
 Medicaid enrollment, private insurance coverage, and overall insurance coverage on either side
 of the age limits of the laws. We conclude that the modest impacts of the expansions on health
 insurance coverage arose because of very low takeup rates of the newly available coverage, rather
 than from crowd-out of private insurance coverage.

Title: Did Expanding Medicaid Affect Welfare Participation?
Abstract:  Using data from the 1988-1996 Current Population Surveys (CPS), we re-examine the evidence
 presented in Yelowitz (1995) showing that expansions in Medicaid eligibility for children were associated
 with increased labor force participation and reduced participation in Aid to Families with Dependent
 Children (AFDC) among single mothers. We find that Yelowitz's results were the result of two factors.
 First, he imposed a strong restriction on the parameter estimates that is not predicted by theory and is rejected in the CPS data.
 Second, he used only one of the two income tests that families must pass to be eligible for AFDC, resulting in higher imputed AFDC
 breakeven income levels for larger families. Once these problems are addressed, the Medicaid income limits have no significant effect
 on AFDC participation. The AFDC income limits, however, are significantly related to welfare and labor force participation in both his
 original sample and the entire 1988-1996 sample.

Title: Sometimes Close is Good Enough: The Value of Nearby Environmental Amenities
Abstract:  An extensive empirical literature exists showing that variations in region-specific
 amenities can account for persistent differences in real wages across regions. However,
 this literature has considered only amenities in the same location as the household. This
 paper argues that environmental amenities at some distance from but accessible to urban
 areas may lead to negative compensating wage differentials. We use a general
 equilibrium framework and data from the 1995 Current Population Survey to calculate
 implicit amenity prices based on measures of distance to environmental amenities. Our
 results suggest that amenities outside the metropolitan area do generate compensating
 wage differentials, as workers are willing to accept lower wages to live in accessible
 proximity to Â“niceÂ” places. This implies that these places provide a positive externality
 to those communities that find them accessible. The estimated effects are quantitatively
 important, suggesting that these externalities should be taken into account in policy
 making.

Title: Impure Public Goods and the Comparative Statics of Environmentally Friendly Consumption
Author-Name: Matthew J. Kotchen
Author-Person: pko326
Author-Workplace-Name: Williams College
Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://econ.williams.edu
Abstract: This paper develops an impure public good model to analyze the comparative statics of
 environmentally friendly consumption. Â“GreenÂ” products are treated as impure public goods
 that arise through joint production of a private characteristic and an environmental public
 characteristic. The model is distinct from existing impure public good models because
 it considers the availability of substitutes. Specifically, the model accounts for the way
 that the jointly produced characteristics of a green product may be available separately as
 wellÂ—through a conventional-good substitute, direct donations to improve environmental
 quality, or both. The analysis provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how
 demand for green products and demand for environmental quality depend on market prices,
 green-production technologies, and ambient environmental quality. The comparative static
 results generate new insights into the important and sometimes counterintuitive relationship
 between demand for green products and demand for environmental quality.

Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://econ.williams.edu
Abstract: This paper develops a general model of private provision of a public good that includes the option
 to consume an impure public good. I use the model to investigate positive and normative
 consequences of Â“green markets.Â” Green markets give consumers a new choice: instead of simply
 consuming a private good and making a donation to an environmental public good, consumers
 can purchase an impure public good that produces characteristics of both activities jointly. Many
 governments, nongovernmental organizations, and industries promote green markets as a decentralized
 mechanism of environmental policy. Nevertheless, I show that under quite reasonable
 assumptions, green markets can have detrimental eâ‚¬ects on both environmental quality and social
 welfare. I then derive conditions that are suÂ¢cient to rule out such unintended consequences.
 The analysis applies equally to non-environmental choice settings where the joint products of
 an impure public good are also available separately. Such choice settings are increasingly prevalent
 in the economy, with impure public goods ranging from socially-responsible investments to
 commercial activities associated with charitable fund-raising.

Abstract: This paper analyzes how corporate capital gains taxes affect the capital gain realization decisions of firms.
 The paper outlines the tax treatment of corporate capital gains, the consequent incentives for firms with gains and losses,
 the efficiency consequences of these taxes in the context of other taxes and capital market distortions, and the response of
 firms to these incentives. Despite receiving limited attention, corporate capital gain realizations have averaged 30 percent
 of individual capital gain realizations over the last fifty years and have increased dramatically in importance over the
 last decade. By 1999, the ratio of net long-term capital gains to income subject to tax was 21 percent and was distributed
 across a variety of industries suggesting the importance of realization behavior to corporate financing decisions. Time-series
 analysis of aggregate realization behavior demonstrates that corporate capital gains taxes impact realization behavior significantly.
 Similarly, an analysis of firm-level investment and property, plant, and equipment (PPE) disposal decisions and gain recognition
 behavior similarly suggests an important role for these taxes in determining when firms raise money by disposing of assets and realizing gains.

Abstract: This paper examines the responsiveness of investment to q (i.e., the ratio of a firm's market value to the replacement
 cost of its assets) using data on a unique type of firm: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). For REITs, we have high quality
 estimates of the net asset value of the firm that we use to create relatively accurate measures of Tobin's q. In addition, REITs
 have institutional features that mitigate some of the complications faced by previous studies. We have three main results. First,
 there is little evidence of a statistical link between REIT investment and a traditional accounting-based measure of q. Second,
 REIT investment is highly sensitive to estimates of q that are based on analysts' appraisals of asset value. A REIT whose NAV-based
 q ratio rises from 1.0 to 1.1 will increase its assets by 4.3 percent in the next year. Third, the difference between the appraisal-based
 measure of q and the traditional accounting based measure typically increases with the age of the firm's assets and varies across
 types of properties. These results suggest that measurement error in q can lead to appreciable downward biases in investment
 sensitivities, even in an industry that seems to meet many of the assumptions in Tobin's original paper, but that Tobin's
 investment model performs well with a better measure of q.

Abstract: Development practitioners in the West have proclaimed that a "feminization of agriculture" is occurring in the developing world.
 In this paper, I use household survey data collected in rural China to empirically test whether or not women have been doing an
 increasing amount of farmwork.  I find exactly the opposite-- if anything, the proportion of farmwork being done by women is
 declining over the late 1990s.  Furthermore, I analyze the demographic composition of the farm labor force and find that the future
 feminization of agriculture is unlikely.

  to generate hypotheses about the relationship consistent with our descriptive
  findings.  We test the hypotheses using household data collected in rural China in
  2000 and find that in poorer areas migration increases consumptive investment
 by nearly 20 percent.  We find no evidence of a link between migration and productive
  investment.

Title: The Role of Agriculture in Development
Abstract:  A longstanding question in economics is why some countries are so much richer than
 others. Today, for example, income per capita in the worldÂ’s richest countries is roughly
 thirty-five times greater than it is in the worldÂ’s poorest countries. Recent work (e.g.,
 Robert E. Lucas 2001, and Rachel Ngai 1999) argues that the proximate cause of this
 disparity is that todayÂ’s poor countries began the process of industrialization much later
 and that this process is slow.
 In this paper we argue that a model of structural transformation provides a useful
 theory of both why industrialization occurs at different dates, and why it proceeds slowly.
 A key implication of this model is that growth in agricultural productivity is central to
 development, a message that also appears prominently in the traditional development
 literature. (See, e.g., Peter Timmer (1986)).

Title: Farm Work, Home Work and International Productivity Differences
Abstract:  AgricultureÂ’s share of economic activity is known to vary inversely with a countryÂ’s level of
 development. This paper examines whether extensions of the neoclassical growth model can
 account for some important sectoral patterns observed in a current cross-section of countries and
 in the time series data for currently rich countries. We find that a straightforward agricultural
 extension of the neoclassical growth model restricted to match U.S. observations fails to account
 for important aspects of the cross-country data. We then introduce a version of the growth model
 with home production, and we show that this model performs much better.

Title: Sequencing and the Success of Gradualism: Empirical Evidence from China's Agricultural Reform
Abstract:  This paper provides evidence regarding gains to agricultural market liberalization in China.
 We empirically identify the different effects that incentive reforms and gradual market liberalization have
 on China's agricultural economy during its transition period.  We find that average gains within the agricultural
 sector to incentive reform exceed gains to market liberalization by a factor of ten.  Our method of analyzing the
 effects of transition policies on economic performance can be generalized to other reform paths in other transition economies.

Title: Taxes Versus Regulation: The Welfare Impacts of Policies for Containing Sprawl
Abstract: Our central concern in this paper is to examine some alternative policies for physically containing the
 growth of urban areas. We undertake a microsimulation to provide a comparison between land use
 planning policies that enforce an urban growth boundary and policies that limit development at the
 periphery using taxes. We parameterise our microsimulation using the structure of demand and policy
 implemented in a rapidly growing city in the south of England. We make no judgment as to the
 optimality or otherwise of the existing degree of constraint: we take that as datum and analyse only the
 welfare costs, distributional impacts and effects on urban densities of alternative ways of achieving the
 currently observed degree of constraint. The methodology we deploy to address these issues could be
 turned to a wide range of other urban modeling purposes. It has the advantage of being clearly founded
 in microeconomic theory and applies observed behavioural relationships, estimated from the relevant
 economic data. We find that the use of a tax on land could produce the same limitation on growth as
 existing regulatory policies but provide higher equilibrium welfare levels. We find that the use of a tax
 on transport costs, however, while capable of producing a compact urban form, would not raise welfare
 when compared with regulatory approaches.

Title: AFDC, SSI, and Welfare Reform Aggressiveness: Caseload Reductions vs. Caseload Shifting
Abstract:  Welfare reform has made receipt of cash benefits more difficult and less attractive for single
 mothers. We examine whether reforms of AFDC affected caseloads of another program -
 Supplemental Security Income (SSI). We exploit state variation in welfare reform over time, and find
 that female-headed households in states aggressively pursuing welfare reform were 21.6 percent more
 likely to receive SSI. This implies that a decrease in caseloads in one program cannot be interpreted
 as an equal-sized decrease in the number of families receiving public assistance. In addition, our
 results have policy implications for the well-being of families affected by welfare reform time limits.

Title: The Welfare Implications of Increasing Disability Insurance Benefit Generosity
Abstract:  The focus on efficiency costs in the empirical literature on Disability Insurance (DI)
 provides a misleading view of the adequacy of payment levels. In order to evaluate whether
 workers are over- or under-insured through the social insurance program, we develop a
 framework that allows us to simulate the benefits as well as the costs associated with marginal
 changes in payment generosity from a representative cross-sectional sample of the population.
 Under the assumption that individuals are reasonably risk averse, our simulations suggest the
 typical worker would value increased benefits somewhat above the average costs of providing
 them. However, we find that benefit increases tend to lower average utility when we average
 across all individuals in our sample, particularly at high levels of risk aversion. This
 counterintuitive finding arises because some lower income DI-insured workers face replacement
 rates that are near or above one. For such individuals, a benefit increase would represent transfers
 from an even lower income state of the world in which they are not on DI to one in which they
 are, a transfer that would not be beneficial even if there were no behavioral distortions associated
 with the provision of DI benefits.

Title: Model Selection in an Information Economy : Choosing what to Learn
Abstract: As online markets for the exchange of goods and services become more common, the study of markets composed
 at least in part of autonomous agents has taken on increasing importance. In contrast to traditional completeinformation
 economic scenarios, agents that are operating in an electronic marketplace often do so under considerable
 uncertainty. In order to reduce their uncertainty, these agents must learn about the world around them. When an agent
 producer is engaged in a learning task in which data collection is costly, such as learning the preferences of a consumer
 population, it is faced with a classic decision problem: when to explore and when to exploit. If the agent has a
 limited number of chances to experiment, it must explicitly consider the cost of learning (in terms of foregone profit)
 against the value of the information acquired. Information goods add an additional dimension to this problem; due
 to their flexibility, they can be bundled and priced according to a number of different price schedules. An optimizing
 producer should consider the profit each price schedule can extract, as well as the difficulty of learning of this
 schedule.
 	In this paper, we demonstrate the tradeoff between complexity and profitability for a number of common price
 schedules. We begin with a one-shot decision as to which schedule to learn. Schedules with moderate complexity are
 preferred in the short and medium term, as they are learned quickly, yet extract a significant fraction of the available
 profit. We then turn to the repeated version of this one-shot decision and show that moderate complexity schedules, in
 particular two-part tariff, perform well when the producer must adapt to nonstationarity in the consumer population.
 When a producer can dynamically change schedules as it learns, it can use an explicit decision-theoretic formulation
 to greedily select the schedule which appears to yield the greatest profit in the next period. By explicitly considering
 the both the learnability and the profit extracted by different price schedules, a producer can extract more profit as it
 learns than if it naively chose models that are accurate once learned.

Title: Carbon Taxation When Climate Affects Productivity
Abstract: Optimal carbon taxation is evaluated in a model where climate change affects productivity. With a numerical US
 economy model with preexisting taxes, the optimal carbon tax is found to exceed marginal social damage by 53 percent and "marginal private damage"
 (the sum of households?marginal willingness to pay) by 73 percent. The welfare gain from optimal carbon taxation is estimated at $3.58 billion
 per year when marginal damages are $40/ton; employment also increases. Setting the carbon tax at the Pigouvian rate raises welfare by only $3.17
 billion. The contrasting results in the Â“tax interaction" literature are due to the use of Â“marginal private damage" when applied to amenity
 externalities.

Title: Economic Growth and Environmental Resource Allocation
Abstract: The simple fact that environmental resources are endowments is found to have profound effects on their
 patterns of allocation with changes in income, population, and income inequality. For broad classes of theoretical models,
 and in Pareto efficient as well as decentralized economies, environmental quality is found to follow a U-shaped pattern with
 rising income. We examine population changes and variations in income inequality, and also find U-shaped patterns of behavior.
 Importantly, the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and environmental quality can generally be expected to rise
 monotonically with rising income. These results are found to have important policy implications.

Title: Setting Environmental Taxes in a Second-best World
Abstract: This paper compares the optimal environmental tax with two alternative definitions of marginal environmental damages.
 One definition reflects the social marginal rate of substitution between income and the environment; the other reflects the sum
 of households' marginal willingness to pay. The analysis finds that the definition based on the social marginal rate of substitution
 provides a consistent benchmark for setting environmental taxes that is compatible with both the Pigouvian principle and the double
 dividend hypothesis. The definition based on the sum of households' marginal willingness to pay, however, is found to be incompatible
 with optimal taxation and an unreliable benchmark for making welfare inferences.

Title: Environmental and Distortionary Taxes: Comment
Abstract: This note argues that the conclusions and inferences in a recent literature on second-best environmental taxation
 are due to the use of a particular definition of  "marginal social damage," one that is not based on the marginal rate of
 substitution between income and the environment for the social planner's problem. In particular, the definition used values
 an incremental unit of income in a way that does not reflect its Pareto efficient use. When the definition of marginal social
 damage from pollution is based on the social marginal rate of substitution between income and environmental quality, the optimal
 environmental tax is found to exceed marginal social damage in a second-best setting with revenue-raising taxes. Since, in the
 first-best case with no binding revenue requirement, the optimal environmental tax equals marginal social damage, it follows
 directly that the optimal environmental tax rises with increasing and binding revenue requirements over the range under consideration.

Title: Getting Income Shares Right
Abstract: Many widely used economic models implicitly assume that income
 shares should be identical across time and space.  Although time series
 data from industrial countries appear consistent with this notion,
 cross-section data generally appear to contradict the assumption of
 constant income shares.  A commonly used calculation suggests that labor
 shares of national income vary from about 0.05 to about 0.80 in
 international cross-section data.  This paper suggests, however, that this
 widely used approach underestimates the labor income of the self-employed
 and other proprietors.  Several adjustments for calculating labor shares
 are identified and compared.  All of them yield data that appear broadly
 consistent with the hypothesis that labor shares for most countries fall in
 the range of 0.65 to 0.80

Title: Land Reform and the Political Organization of Agriculture
Abstract:  The modern theory of agrarian organization has studied how the economic environment
 determines organizational form under the assumption of stable property
 rights to land. The political economy literature has modelled the endogenous determination of
 property rights. In this paper we propose a model in which the
 economic organization of agriculture and the political equilibrium determining the
 distribution of property rights are jointly determined. In particular, because the
 form of organization may affect the probability and distribution of beneÃžts from
 agrarian reform, it may be determined in anticipation of this impact. The model
 offers a reason for why tenancy, despite its economic advantages has been so little
 used in countries where agrarian reform is a salient political issue. We argue that
 this in particular helps to understand the dearth of tenancy and the relative failure
 of land reform in Latin America.

Title: Managing Economic Insecurity in Rural El Salvador:
 The role of asset ownership and labor market adjustments
Abstract:  Rural households often rely heavily on short-term readjustments in labor supply between
 wage and self-employment in farm and non-farm activities as an essential strategy to protect
 consumption and the value of productive investments against unexpected shocks and to take
 advantage of changing economic opportunities. The efficacy of such coping strategies, and
 hence a householdÂ’s vulnerability to shocks, may in turn be affected by that householdÂ’s
 ownership of land or other assets. This paper employs a two-round panel survey of 494 rural
 households in El Salvador to study the impact of a 1997 weather-related downturn in
 economic activity and agricultural labor demand on household incomes and welfare.
 Examining the changing pattern of household labor supply and poverty, reveals that the loss
 of wage labor hours was a primary determinant of the rise in poverty in this period, and that
 landless agricultural laborers were particularly vulnerable. Panel regression analyses suggest
 that households that owned even small amounts of land or other productive assets were
 better able to protect the marginal return to household labor in the downturn year. The
 results lend support to the view that in response to shocks, households fall back on farm and
 non-farm self-employment activities were productivity was determined by their ability to
 intensify the use of land and other owned assets. Controlling for other factors, ownership of
 land and other assets also helped households to maintain children's school enrollments.

Title: Latifundia Economics
Abstract:  This paper proposes a simple general equilibrium theory of agrarian production
 organization to explain the emergence and persistence of latifundia -
 minifundia type patterns of agrarian production organization such as have prevailed
 historically in many parts of Latin America. When land ownership is
 concentrated, the exercise of market power over land can facilitate the exercise
 of control over labor, as labor supply to landlord estates is affected by peasant
 access to land. Equilibria may emerge where landlords, behaving as multimarket
 Cournot oligopolists, inefficiently hoard land to drive up land rentals
 and corral cheaper labor into their expanding estates. Labor-service tenancy
 arrangements, similar to those used in practice, emerge as landlords try to
 price discriminate. These contracts help to restore allocative inefficiency but
 lead to lower equilibrium peasant wages and welfare. Population growth, differential
 technical progress on landlord and peasant farms, and other changes
 in the physical and economic environment are shown to transform equilibrium
 patterns of agrarian production organization in ways that are consistent with
 agrarian trajectories observed in late nineteenth century Chile and several other
 regions and periods. The model also clarifies how agentsÂ’ incentives to challenge
 property rights change along with equilibrium agrarian structures.

Title: Gross Capital Flows and Asymmetric Information
Abstract: This paper shows that the behavior of gross capital
 flows can identify the nature of information asymmetries in
 international equity markets. Information asymmetry
 between foreign and domestic investors implies a
 correlation between net flows and returns. Information asymmetry
 within groups of foreign and domestic investors implies
 that gross flows and absolute returns are correlated. I find that
 the correlation between gross flows and absolute returns is
 stronger than the correlation between net flows and returns,
 suggesting that information asymmetries within countries are more important than those between countries.

Title: Reform and Growth in Latin America: All Pain, No Gain?
Abstract:  This paper addresses the adequacy of post-reform growth in Latin America in the 1990s on the basis of
 international comparisons as well as historical and other relevant standards, analytically exploring and empirically
 testing a number of hypotheses to explain the perceived dissatisfaction with growth performance in the region. We
 find that there is no Â“growth puzzleÂ” in Latin America. Growth has not been higher in the post-reform period not
 because of a failure of reforms to yield the growth payoff that they should have been expected to do on the basis of
 international experience, but because of the combination of an unfavorable external environment with insufficient
 depth and breadth of reform. We also estimate the long-run growth payoff of macroeconomic reforms, the
 additional gains that can be achieved by deepening this first generation of reforms, and the potential payoff from
 broadening the scope of reform into a second generation of reforms encompassing deeper structural and institutional
 areas.

Title: Post-Crisis Exchange Rate Policy in Five Asian Countries: Filling in the Â“Hollow MiddleÂ”?
Abstract:  Following the 1997Â–98 financial turmoil, crisis countries in Asia moved toward either floating
 or fixed exchange rate systems, superficially consistent with the bipolar view of exchange rate
 regimes and the Â“hollow middleÂ” hypothesis. But some observers have claimed that, despite the
 changes in their de jure exchange rate regimes, the crisis countriesÂ’ policies have de facto been
 very similar in the post- and pre-crisis periods. This paper analyzes the evidence and concludes
 that, except for Malaysia, which adopted a hard peg and imposed capital controls, the other
 crisis countries are floating more than before, though less than Â“realÂ” floaters do. The
 intermediate exchange rate policies pursued by most of the crisis countries during the post-crisis
 can be justified on second-best arguments.

Title: Do Domestic Investors Have an Information Advantage? Evidence from Indonesia
Abstract:  Using transaction data from the Jakarta Stock Exchange, I nd three pieces of evidence which
 indicate that domestic investors have an information advantage over foreign investors. First, foreign
 investors systematically buy at higher and sell at lower intra-day prices than domestic investors.
 Second, foreign investors tend to sell prior to large positive returns. Finally, the permanent impact
 of foreign purchases is smaller than that of domestic purchases. Over time, prices at which foreign
 investors trade have worsened, while foreign selling prior to positive returns has disappeared.

Title: The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Labor Market Transitions
Abstract:  An often-cited difficulty with moving low-income families out of welfare and into the labor force
 is the lack of health insurance in many low-wage jobs. Consequently, many low-income
 household heads may be reluctant to leave welfare and thereby lose health insurance coverage for
 their children. The expansions in the Medicaid program to cover low-income children and
 pregnant women who are not eligible for cash benefits may help alleviate the problem by
 allowing disadvantaged household heads to accept jobs which do not provide health insurance.
 We use a discrete time (monthly) hazard rate model and data from several panels of the Survey of
 Income and Program Participation to assess whether expansion of public health insurance to
 cover children of working parents contributes to increase transitions out of welfare and into
 employment and reduce transitions into welfare and out of employment. We model spells in
 progress and spells that start during the sample separately, which allows us to assess the effect on
 long-term welfare recipients. We find some evidence that expanded Medicaid eligibility for
 children leads single mothers to exit welfare more quickly; however the effects are not robust to
 the inclusion of year effects. In addition, the effect appears to be strongest and most consistent
 among long-term recipients (as proxied by recipients who begin the sample on welfare). We find
 less evidence of an effect of expanded Medicaid eligibility on transitions into welfare. A
 somewhat surprising finding is that higher AFDC income limits also appear to have little effect
 on the probability of such transitions.

Title: Purchasing Power Parity Tests in Cointegrated Panels
Abstract:  This paper employs recently developed techniques for testing
 hypotheses in cointegrated panels to test the strong version of purchasing
 power parity for a panel of post Bretton Woods data. We compare results
 using fully modifed and dynamic OLS approaches, and strongly reject the
 hypothesis. We also introduce a new between-dimension dynamic OLS
 estimator and find that the between-dimensio n FMOLS and DOLS estimates
 of the long-run deviation from purchasing power parity are larger
 than the correspondin g within-dimension estimates. Finally, we attempt to
 reconcile these rejections with the mixed findings that have been reported
 in panel unit root studies.

Title: Taxation by Auction: Fund-Raising by 19th Century Indian Guilds
Abstract:  We describe a unique institution used by 19th century Indian guilds to raise funds: The guild
 members agreed that on a particular day all but one of their shops would be shut. An auction would
 be held to determine which one shop would remain open, and the winning bid would go to the guild
 funds. We compare this Â“taxation by auctionÂ” mechanism with more conventional tax schemes and
 show that under certain conditions, not only will a majority of the guild members prefer to be taxed
 via an auction, but that this form of taxation will be more equitable than other forms.

Title: Gender and Corruption
Abstract:  Using several independent data sets, we investigate the relationship between gender and
 corruption. We show using micro data that women are less involved in bribery, and are less likely to
 condone bribe taking. Cross-country data show that corruption is less severe where women hold a larger
 share of parliamentary seats and senior positions in the government bureaucracy, and comprise a larger
 share of the labor force.

Title: Community Based Targeting for Social Safety Nets
Abstract:  This paper interprets case studies and theory on community involvement in beneficiary
 selection and benefit delivery for social safety nets. Several considerations should be
 carefully balanced in assessing the advantages of using community groups as targeting
 agents. First, benefits from utilizing local information and social capital may be eroded
 by costly rent-seeking. Second, the potential improvement in targeting criteria from
 incorporating local notions of deprivation must be tempered by the possibility of program
 capture by local elites, and by the possibility that local preferences are not pro-poor.
 Third, performance may be undermined by unforeseen strategic targeting by local
 communities in response to national funding and evaluation criteria, or by declines in
 political support.

Title: Of Pirates and Moneylenders: Product Market Competition and
 the Depth of Lending relationships in a rural market in Chile
Abstract:  It is often suggested that interlinked and monitored loan contract terms such as those
 used by trader-lenders in rural markets serve as collateral substitutes and therefore
 should benefit asset-poor borrowers in particular. Yet, empirically this is not always
 true. For example, most of the new monitored finance from contract farming firms and
 agro-industry traders during ChileÂ’s recent agricultural boom went to medium and large
 commercial farmers and traditional forms of monitored finance for collateral poor
 farmers from informal trader-moneylenders actually may have declined. Based on
 interviews and historical accounts of this market and the analysis of a theoretical model,
 this paper argues that lenders may have been forced to reduce tied-credit to small
 farmers in several crops because increased product market competition exacerbated the
 problem of "pirates sales'' or post-harvest opportunistic default. This further restricted
 the already narrow set of enforceable property claims upon which monitored credit
 contracts to solve ex-ante moral hazard contracting problems could have been fashioned.
 This problem was avoided in crops where product markets are more concentrated and in
 export activities where crop liens are easier to establish with better capitalized farmers.
 The model points to an important connection between the nature of market competition
 and the depth of lending relationships that appears to be important in many other
 contexts.

Title: Monitoring by Peers or by Delegates? Joint Liability Loans under Moral Hazard
Abstract:  This paper analyzes the conditions under which joint liability loans to encourage peer-monitoring
 would be offered and chosen ahead of monitored individual liability alternatives on a competitive
 loan market when production and monitoring activities are subject to moral hazard. In contrast to
 other analyses, the case for joint liability loans does not rest on an assumed monitoring or
 information advantage by borrowers but instead relies on a incentive diversification effect that
 cannot be replicated by outside intermediaries. Joint liability clauses are chosen to implement a
 preferred Nash equilibrium in a multi-agent, multi-tasking game, where borrowers must be given
 incentives to be diligent as financed entrepreneurs and as monitors of others. Potential side
 contracting or collusion amongst borrowers is shown to only harm credit access, even when
 borrowers enjoy a monitoring advantage relative to outsiders.

Title: Distinguishing Transitory and Permanent Price Elasticities of
 Charitable Giving with Pre-Announced Changes in Tax Law
Abstract: This paper develops and applies a new estimation technique
 for distinguishing transitory and permanent price and income
 elasticities of charitable giving using panel data. Twelve-year
 individual averages of income and deductions are combined with
 information on legislated changes in tax schedules, to construct
 instruments for permanent price and income variation.  Unlike the
 previous literature, pre-announced changes in tax law are used to
 identify transitory variation, and fixed-effects are used to control
 for unobserved heterogeneity.  The timing of giving is found to be
 significantly more responsive to tax incentives than is the long-run
 level of giving.

Title: The Effect of Taxes on Portfolio Choice: Evidence from Panel
 Data Spanning the Tax Reform Act of 1986
Abstract: This paper estimates the effect of marginal tax rates on
 demands for various financial assets, using the 1983-1989 Survey of
 Consumer Finances (SCF) panel.  In the cross-section, marginal tax
 rates appear to have a strong and statistically significant influence
 on portfolio allocations, even after controlling for income and
 wealth.  For example, people with high tax rates tend to hold larger
 shares of their assets in equities, which are taxed relatively
 lightly due to the treatment of capital gains.  Cross-sectional
 estimates could be biased, however, if the marginal tax rate is
 correlated with unobserved influences on portfolio choice, such as
 financial sophistication, preferences for risk or liquidity, or
 degree to which portfolio choices are constrained by Social
 Security. These unobserved variables, like the marginal tax rate, are
 likely to be related to income and wealth in a positive and non-linear
 fashion, so that the marginal tax rate may serve as a proxy for them.
 This paper utilizes the SCF panel to estimate fixed-effects and
 correlated random-effects (Chamberlain, 1984) models, which effectively
 control for this unobserved heterogeneity.  Identification is provided
 by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which changed marginal tax rates by
 very different amounts for different people.  The empirical results
 confirm that, without controlling for unobserved heterogeneity,
 marginal tax rates have a strong influence on portfolio choices.
 After controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, however, the magnitude
 of the effect is much smaller and often statistically insignificant.
 These results are found to be robust to efforts to distinguish between
 unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence (i.e., slow adjustment
 of portfolios).

Title: The Effect of Local Fiscal Policies on Urban Wage Structure
Abstract:  While it has long been recognized that average wages vary strikingly across regions and urban
 areas, differences in the variance of wages remain relatively unexplored. In this paper we
 empirically examine differences in the extent and persistence of wage dispersion across urban
 areas. Using data from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, we show that metropolitan area wage
 distributions vary, that the variation is substantial, and that it is not entirely accounted for by
 differences in the supply of workers with different skills or the size or geographic region of the
 city. We find that the differences in wage distributions across cities are highly persistent. We
 investigate whether there is a link between local fiscal policy and the degree of dispersion in the
 wage structure, and find evidence that such a relationship exists. Cities with higher overall
 taxes, fewer transfers from state and federal governments, and a greater share of spending on
 public health and community development appear to have higher levels of overall dispersion. In
 addition, we find that cities that rely more heavily on property taxes have greater dispersion in
 the lower half of the wage distribution, and cities with higher expenditures on education have
 more dispersion in the upper half.

Title: Fully Modified OLS for Heterogeneous Cointegrated Panels
Abstract:  This chapter uses fully modified OLS principles to develop new methods
 for estimating and testing hypotheses for cointegrating vectors in dynamic
 panels in a manner that is consistent with the degree of cross sectional
 heterogeneity that has been permitted in recent panel unit root and panel
 cointegration studies. The asymptotic properties of various estimators are
 compared based on pooling along the Â‘withinÂ’ and Â‘betweenÂ’ dimensions
 of the panel. By using Monte Carlo simulations to study the small sample
 properties, the group mean estimator is shown to behave well even in
 relatively small samples under a variety of scenarios.

Title: Critical Values for Cointegration Tests in Heterogeneous Panels with Multiple Regressors
Abstract:  In this paper we describe a method for testing the null of no cointegration in
 dynamic panels with multiple regressors and compute approximate critical
 values for these tests. Methods for non-stationary panels, including panel
 unit root and panel cointegration tests, have been gaining increased acceptance
 in recent empirical research. To date, however, tests for the null of no
 cointegration in heterogeneous panels based on Pedroni (1995, 1997a) have
 been limited to simple bivariate examples, in large part due to the lack of
 critical values available for more complex multivariate regressions. The
 purpose of this paper is to Â®ll this gap by describing a method to implement
 tests for the null of no cointegration for the case with multiple regressors
 and to provide appropriate critical values for these cases. The tests allow for
 considerable heterogeneity among individual members of the panel, including
 heterogeneity in both the long-run cointegrating vectors as well as
 heterogeneity in the dynamics associated with short-run deviations from
 these cointegrating vectors.

Title: Pricing and Bundling Electronic Information Goods: Field Evidence
Abstract:  Dramatic increases in the capabilities and decreases in the costs of computers and communication
 networks have fomented revolutionary thoughts in the scholarly publishing community.
 In one dimension, traditional pricing schemes and product packages are being modified or replaced.
 We designed and undertook a large-scale field experiment in pricing and bundling for
 electronic access to scholarly journals: PEAK. We provided Internet-based delivery of content
 from 1200 Elsevier Science journals to users at multiple campuses and commercial facilities.
 Our primary research objective was to generate rich empirical evidence on user behavior when
 faced with various bundling schemes and price structures. In this article we report initial results.
 We found that although there is a steep initial learning curve, decision-makers rapidly comprehended
 our innovative pricing schemes. We also found that our novel and flexible "generalized
 subscription" was successful at balancing paid usage with easy access to a larger body of content
 than was previously available to participating institutions. Finally, we found that both monetary
 and non-monetary user costs have a significant impact on the demand for electronic access.
